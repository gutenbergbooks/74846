<p>Al-Ghazali was a rare combination of
scholar and saint, of the orthodox Moslem
and the aberrant Sufi. This work is
a real contribution to the history of religion, and
will have a peculiar value which attaches to Sufism
at the present time. On the one hand we have the
anthropologists engaged in the task (and for the
most part successfully engaged) of tracing all religions
to a common root, or roots, in the constitution
and the fears of primitive man; on the other
hand we have the mystics, of whom the Sufi is a
leading representative, who are occupied in demonstrating
experimentally that all religions which
start at the bottom find their way to the top.</p>

<p>William Penn said something in the same direction
when he affirmed that all good men were
of the same religion, and that they would
know one another when the livery was off. But
what did he mean by taking the livery off? The
abstinence from rites, ceremonies and the like is a
negative process which certainly would not satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
the genuine Sufi. He would say with St. Paul,
“Not that we would be unclothed, but rather
clothed upon, that mortality may be swallowed up
of life.” That is real mystic language, and suggests
that we shall know one another, not so much
by being denuded of tradition and superstition
(however desirable the process may be in some
points of view), as by putting on the robe of light
and sitting down in the heavenly places with Jesus
Christ, <i>and with any one else whom He calls into
His companionship</i>.</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali tells us in his Confessions that he
found the true way of life in Sufism, that is, in
Pantheism, yet he remained an orthodox Moslem,
that is, a Transcendentalist. At the present time,
when the effects of a war of unheard and unequalled
severity are still perplexing men, the
Transcendent and the Immanent views of God are
alike hard put to it. Sufism is on its back, Transcendentalism
can scarcely keep its feet. It is a
poor time of day for seeing God in all, almost as
ill a time for believing Him to be over all. Where
speculation fails, or limps along with lame feet or
with broken wing, there must be some other way of
taking us to God Himself, beyond reason and safer
than imagination. Al-Ghazali found it, when he
abandoned his lecture-room and went into the
wilderness. While he still continued to recite the
formulas, which affirm the Unity of God and the
authority of His Apostle, he found his way into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
the Sufi inner sanctuary, where one understands
that</p>

<p class="noindent">The book tells us something about this side of his

<p>There are a score of lives of Mohammed,
the great Arabian Prophet, in the English
language, yet there is no popular biography
of the greatest of all Moslems since his day,
Al-Ghazali. Even the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>
gives only scant information. Professor Duncan
B. Macdonald prepared a life of Al-Ghazali with
special reference to his religious experiences and
influence in a paper published in the twentieth volume
of “The Journal of the American Oriental
Society” (1899), but now out of print. His
scholarly investigations and conclusions, however,
deal with Al-Ghazali’s inner experiences and his
philosophy, rather than with his environment and
the events of his life. We acknowledge our great
indebtedness to his paper and to the original Arabic
sources on which it was based, especially the introduction
to the Commentary on the <i>Ihya</i> by Sayyid
Murtadha in ten volumes and entitled <i>Ithaf as-saʿada</i>.
I have found additional material in Al-Ghazali’s
writings and other books mentioned in the
bibliography given in the appendix of this book,
especially the <i>Tabaqat ash-shafaiʾya</i> by As-Subqi,
who wrote long before Murtadha and to whom
Macdonald refers, but whose work he did not use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>The study of Al-Ghazali’s life and writings will,
more than anything else, awaken a deeper sympathy
for that which is highest and strongest in
the religion of Islam; for the student of his works
learns to appreciate Islam at its best. As Jalal-ud-din
says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fools buy false coins because they are like the true.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If in the world no genuine minted coin</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were current, how would forgers pass the false?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Falsehood were nothing unless truth were there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To make it specious. ’Tis the love of right</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lures men to wrong. Let poison but be mixed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With sugar, they will cram it into their mouths.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, cry not that all creeds are vain! Some scent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of truth they have, else they would not beguile.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is a real sense in which Al-Ghazali may be
used as a schoolmaster to lead Moslems to Christ.
His books are full of references to the teaching of
Christ. He was a true seeker after God.</p>

<p>Islam is the prodigal son, the Ishmael, among the
non-Christian religions; this is a fact we may not
forget. Now we read in Christ’s matchless parable
of the prodigal how “When he was yet a great
way off his father saw him and ran out to meet
him and fell on his neck and kissed him.” Have
missionaries always had this spirit? No one can
read the story of Al-Ghazali’s life, so near and yet
so far from the Kingdom of God, so eager to enter
and yet always groping for the doorway, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
fervently wishing that Al-Ghazali could have met a
true ambassador of Christ. Then surely this great
champion of the Moslem faith would have become
an apostle of Christianity in his own day and
generation. By striving to understand Al-Ghazali
we may at least better fit ourselves to help those
who, like him, are earnest seekers after God amid
the twilight shadows of Islam. His life also has
a lesson for us all in its devout Theism and in its
call to the practice of the Presence of God.</p>

<p>“Between the civilizations of Christendom and
Islam there is a gulf which no human genius, no
concourse of events, can entirely bridge over. The
most celebrated Orientals, whether in war or policy,
in literature or learning, are little more than names
for Europeans.”</p>

<p>“With the time came the man. He was Al-Ghazali,
the greatest, certainly the most sympathetic figure in
the history of Islam, and the only teacher of the after
generations ever put by a Muslim on a level with the
four great Imams. The equal of Augustine in
philosophical and theological importance. By his side
the Aristotelian philosophers of Islam, Ibn Rushd
and all the rest, seem beggarly compilers and
scholiasts. Only Al-Farabi, and that in virtue of his
mysticism, approaches him. In his own person he
took up the life of his time on all its sides and with
it all its problems. He lived through them all and
drew his theology from his experience.”</p>

<h3>I<br>
THE ELEVENTH CENTURY</h3>

<p>The great characters of history may be
compared to mountain peaks that rise
high above the plains and the lower foot-hills
and are visible from great distances because
they dominate the landscape. In the historical
study of Islam four names stand out prominently.
They are those of Mohammed himself; of Al-Bokhari,
the most celebrated collector of the
Traditions; of Al-Ashʾari, the great dogmatic
theologian and the opponent of rationalism; and of
Al-Ghazali, the reformer and mystic. The last
named has left a larger imprint upon the history
of Islam than any man save Mohammed himself.
“If there had been a prophet after Mohammed,”
said As-Suyuti, “it would have been Al-Ghazali.”</p>

<p>It is in his life, and more especially in his writings,
that I believe we can see Islam at its best.
In trying to escape the dead weight of Tradition
and the formalism of its requirements, Moslems
are more and more finding relief in the way of the
mystic. Of all those who have found a deeper
spiritual meaning in the teachings of the Koran and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
even in the multitudinous and puerile detail of the
Moslem ritual, none can equal Al-Ghazali. “He
was,” says Jamal-ud-Din, “the pivot of existence
and the common pool of refreshing waters for all,
the soul of the purest part of the people of the
Faith, and the road for obtaining the satisfaction
of the Merciful.... He became the unique
one of his own day and for all time among the
Moslem learned.” “Al-Ghazali,” said another
writer, nearly contemporary, “is an <i>imam</i> by
whose name breasts are dilated and souls revived,
in whose literary productions the ink horn exults
and the paper quivers with joy, and at the hearing
of whose message voices are hushed and heads are
bowed.”</p>

<p>A celebrated saint, Ahmed As-Sayyed Al-Yamani
Az-Zabîdi, also a contemporary of Al-Ghazali,
said, “When I was sitting one day, lo, I
perceived the gates of heaven opened, and a company
of blessed angels descended, having with them
a green robe and a precious steed. They stood by
a certain grave and brought forth its tenant and
clothed him in the green robe and set him on the
steed and ascended with him from heaven to
heaven, till he passed the seven heavens and rent
after them sixty veils, and I know not whither at
last he reached. Then I asked about him, and
was answered, ‘This is the Imam Al-Ghazali.’
That was after his death; may God Most High
have mercy on him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>Another story is related of him as follows: “In
our time there was a man in Egypt who disliked
Al-Ghazali and abused him and slandered him.
And he saw the Prophet (God bless him and give
him peace!) in a dream; Abu Bakr and ʾOmar
(may God be well pleased with both of them!)
were at his side, and Al-Ghazali was sitting before
him, saying, ‘O Apostle of God, this man speaks
against me!’ Thereupon the Prophet said, ‘Bring
the whips!’ So the man was beaten on account of
Al-Ghazali. Then the man arose from sleep, and
the marks of the whips remained on his back, and
he was wont to weep and tell the story.”</p>

<p>And should this praise seem oriental and extravagant,
we add the words of Professor Duncan
B. Macdonald, who has made a more thorough
study of Al-Ghazali’s life and writings than any
other student of Islam:—“What rigidity of grasp
the hand of Islam would have exercised but for the
influence of Al-Ghazali might be hard to tell; he
saved it from scholastic decrepitude, opened before
the orthodox Moslem the possibility of a life hid in
God, was persecuted in his life as a heretic, and
now ranks as the greatest doctor of the Moslem
Church.”</p>

<p>To understand the importance of Al-Ghazali and
of his teaching we must transport ourselves to the
time in which he lived. We cannot understand a
man unless we know his environment. Biography
is only a thread in the vast web of history, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
which time is broad as well as long. Al-Ghazali
belongs to the small company of torch bearers in
the Dark Ages.</p>

<p>He was born at Tus, in Khorasan, Persia, in the
year 1058 <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>, and died in 1111 <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> When
Al-Ghazali was born Togrul Bey had just taken
Bagdad, Henry IV was Emperor, Nicholas II was
Pope, the Norman conquest had just begun in the
west, and Asia Minor was overrun by the Turks in
the Near East. Among Al-Ghazali’s other contemporaries
in the west were Hildebrand the Pope,
Abelard, Bernard, Anselm, and Peter the Hermit.
About the time he wrote his greatest work, Godfrey
of Bouillon was King of Jerusalem. Al-Ghazali
was struggling with the problem of Islam
in its relation to the human heart thirsting for God,
about two hundred years after Al-Kindi had written
his remarkable apology for the Christian faith at
the court of Haroun-ar-Rashîd and two hundred
years before Raymond Lull laid down his life a
martyr in North Africa.</p>

<p>The condition of the Moslem world had utterly
changed since the days when Busrah with its rival
city Kufa were dominated by the victorious Arabs
of Omar’s Caliphate. The Abbasside Caliphs of
the eleventh century were almost as much the
shadows of former power as the Emperors of the
East; they retained little more than their religious
supremacy. Togrul Bey, the grandson of Seljuk,
had been confirmed by the powerless Caliph Al-Qaʾim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
bi-amr Allah, in all his conquests, loaded
with honours, saluted as King of the East and
West, and endowed with the hand of the Caliph’s
daughter. In the next reign, that of Al-Muqtadi,
the Seljuk Turks captured Jerusalem.</p>

<p>“About the year 1000,” says Nöldeke,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> “Islam
was in a very bad way. The Abbasside Caliphate
had long ceased to be of any importance, the power
of the Arabs had long ago been broken. There
was a multitude of Islamite States, great and
small; but even the most powerful of these, that of
the Fatimids, was very far from being able to give
solidity to the whole, especially as it was Shiʾite....
These nomads (the Turks) caused dreadful
devastation, trampled to the ground the flourishing
civilization of vast territories, and contributed
almost nothing to the culture of the human race;
but they mightily strengthened the religion of Mohammed.
The rude Turks took up with zeal the
faith which was just within reach of their intellectual
powers, and they became its true, often fanatical,
champions against the outside world. They
founded the powerful empire of the Seljuks, and
conquered new regions for Islam in the northwest.
After the downfall of the Seljuk empire they still
continued to be the ruling people in all its older
portions. Had not the warlike character of Islam
been revived by the Turks, the Crusaders perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
might have had some prospect of more enduring
success.”</p>

<p>Togrul Bey was invested with the title of Sultan
in the royal city of Nishapur, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1038. According
to Gibbon, he was the “father of his soldiers
and of his people. By a firm and equal administration
Persia was relieved from the evils of anarchy;
and the same hands which had been imbrued
in blood became the guardians of justice and the
public peace. The more rustic, perhaps the wisest,
portion of the Turkmans continued to dwell in the
tents of their ancestors; and, from the Oxus to the
Euphrates, these military colonies were protected
and propagated by their native princes. But the
Turks of the court and city were refined by business
and softened by pleasure: they imitated the
dress, language, and manners of Persia; and the
royal palaces of Nishapur and Rei displayed the
order and magnificence of a great monarchy. The
most deserving of the Arabians and Persians were
promoted to the honours of the state; and the
whole body of the Turkish nation embraced with
fervour and sincerity the religion of Mahomet.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The first of the great Seljuk Sultans was conspicuous
by his zeal for the Moslem faith. He
spent much time in prayer, and in every city which
he conquered built new mosques. By force of
arms he delivered the Caliph of Bagdad at the
head of an irresistible force and taught the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
of Mosul and Bagdad the lesson of obedience.
Rescued from his enemies, the alliance between the
Caliph and the Sultan was cemented by the marriage
of Togrul’s sister with the successor of the
Prophet. In 1063 Togrul died and his nephew
Alp Arslan succeeded him. His name, therefore,
was pronounced after that of the Caliph in public
prayer by all the Moslems of the Near East.</p>

<p>The character of his rule Gibbon gives us in a
sentence: “The myriads of Turkish horse overspread
a frontier of 600 miles from Taurus to
Erzeroum, and the blood of 136,000 Christians was
a grateful sacrifice to the Arabian prophet.” The
“valiant lion,” for that is the significance of his
name, displayed at once the fierceness and generosity
of a typical Oriental ruler. Christians suffered
dreadful persecution. Enemies were assassinated;
but the learned, the rich, and the favoured
were lavishly rewarded. Arslan was a valiant
warrior of the faith and as eager for the battlefield
as those whom Moore describes:—</p>

<p>Armenia was laid waste in the cruelest manner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
when the capital was taken on June 6, 1064. We
are told that “human blood flowed in torrents, and
so great was the carnage, that the streets were
literally choked up with dead bodies; and the
waters of the river were reddened from the quantity
of bloody corpses.” The wealthy inhabitants
were tortured, the churches pillaged, and the priests
flayed alive. Al-Ghazali was then six years old.</p>

<p>In 1072 Alp Arslan was assassinated. His
eldest son, Malek Shah, succeeded him. He extended
the conquests of his father beyond the Oxus
as far as Bokhara and Samarkand, until his name
was inserted on the coins and in the prayers of the
Tartar kingdom on the borders of China. “From
the Chinese frontiers, he stretched his immediate
jurisdiction or feudatory sway to the west and
south, as far as the mountains of Georgia, the
neighbourhood of Constantinople, the holy city of
Jerusalem, and the spicy groves of Arabia Felix.
Instead of resigning himself to the luxury of the
harem, the shepherd king, both in peace and war,
was in action in the field.”</p>

<p>Nizam Al-Mulk was his vizier, and it is largely
due to his influence that the study of science and
literature revived to such a remarkable degree.
The calendar was reformed, schools and colleges
erected, and the learned competed with each other
for the favour of royalty. For thirty years Nizam
Al-Mulk was honoured by the Caliph as the very
oracle of religion and science. But at the age of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
ninety-three, the venerable statesman, to whom, as
we shall see later, Al-Ghazali owed so much, was
dismissed by his master, accused by his enemies,
and murdered by a fanatic. The last words of
Nizam attested his innocence, and the remainder of
Malek’s life was short and inglorious.</p>

<p>The Arabic language had become dominant
everywhere. Its vocabulary had leavened the
whole lump of languages in the Near East. Every
race with which the Arabs came in contact was
more or less Arabized. “The extent of this influence,”
says Chenery,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> “may be perceived by comparing
the Persian of Firdausi with that of Saʾdi.
The language of the former, who flourished in the
early part of our eleventh century, is tolerably pure,
while the Gulistan, which was produced some two
hundred and fifty years later, is in some places little
more than a piecing together of Arabic words with
a cement of the original tongue. It is to be noticed,
also, that the latter author introduces continually
Arabic verses, as the highest ornaments of his
work, and assumes that his readers are acquainted
with this classic and sacred tongue.”</p>

<p>Trade routes extended everywhere. There was
intercourse with India and China on the east, as
well as with the Spice Islands, so called, of Malaysia.
Caravans carried trade across the whole of
Central Asia and Northern Arabia to the emporiums<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
of the West. Spain had intercourse with
Persia. Al-Hariri praises Busrah “as the spot
where the ship and the camel meet, the sea fish and
the lizard, the camel-leader and the sailor, the fisher
and the tiller.” In other words it was the port and
emporium for all the lands watered by the Euphrates
and Tigris. The same was true of Alexandria
for the West.</p>

<p>We have evidences that an extensive trade was
carried on between Arabia and China in walrus and
ivory. An extensive work exists written in Chinese
in the twelfth century on trade with the Arabs of
which a recent translation has been published at
Petrograd. More remarkable still is the fact that
in Scandinavia thousands of Kufic coins have been
found, nearly all of which date from the eleventh
century. This would indicate that even this remote
part of Europe was in touch with the Near
East.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Judging from literature and history, it was a
time of looseness of morals and of divorce between
religion and ethics, even more startling than in the
world of Islam to-day. There were those who
wrote commentaries on the marvels of the Koran,
like Al-Harawi, yet did not scruple to indulge in
private wine-drinking and carousals and loose conversation.
The place of wine, women, and song,
not only in popular literature and poetry, but even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
in the table talk of theologians and philosophers is
clear evidence. Huart remarks in regard to the
celebrated “Book of the Monasteries,” which is an
anthology of the convents of the Near East: “We
must not forget that, when Moslems went to Christian
cloisters, it was not to seek devotional impulses,
but simply for the sake of an opportunity
of drinking wine, the use of which was forbidden
in the Mohammedan towns. The poets, out of
gratitude, sang the praises of the blessed spots
where they had enjoyed the delights of intoxication.”
Those who dared to preach and write
against this public immorality had to suffer the
consequences; and because hypocrites were in
power reformers were not heeded.</p>

<p>We read of Ibn Hamdun (1101-1167), that
when he openly attacked the evils which he saw
around him in Bagdad, he was dismissed from his
public office as secretary of state, cast into prison,
and left to die. Punishments were cruel. Amputations
for theft, in accordance with the Koran
legislation, were matters of such every-day occurrence
that the maimed man was always a suspect.
We read of Al-Zamakhshari, that one of his feet
had been frost-bitten during a winter storm, necessitating
an amputation, and so he went about with
a wooden leg, but he also carried about with him a
written testimony of witnesses to prove that he had
been maimed by accident, and not in punishment
for a crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>Al-Baihaki, the chronicler of the court at Bagdad,
shows us that the zeal for the faith was often
accompanied by a reckless disregard for the law of
Islam as regards the use of fermented liquor. Not
only the soldiers and their officers had drunken
brawls, but the Sultan Masʾud used to enjoy regular
bouts in which he frequently saw his fellow
topers “under the table.” Here is a scene represented
as having taken place at Ghazni, the capital
of Khorasan province. “Fifty goblets and flagons
of wine were brought from the pavilion into the
garden, and the cups began to go round. ‘Fair
measure,’ said the amir, ‘and equal cups—let us
drink fair.’ They grew merry and the minstrels
sang. One of the courtiers had finished five tankards—each
held nearly a pint of wine—but the
sixth confused him, the seventh bereft him of his
senses, and at the eighth he was consigned to his
servants. The doctor was carried off at his fifth
cup; Khalil Dawud managed ten, Siyabiruz nine,
and then they were taken home; everybody rolled
or was rolled away, till only the Sultan and the
Khwaja Abd-ar-Razzak remained. The Khwaja
finished eighteen goblets and then rose, saying,
‘If your slave has any more he will lose both his
wits and his respect for your Majesty.’ Masʾud
went on alone, and after he had drunk twenty-seven
full cups, he too arose, called for water and
prayer-carpet, washed, and recited the belated noon
and sunset prayers together as soberly as if he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
not tasted a drop; then mounted his elephant and
rode to the palace.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Masʾud was put to death in 1040. His sons and
descendants for more than a century ruled this part
of the Moslem world. But Ghazni fell from the
proud position of the capital of a kingdom to a
mere dependency of the Empire of Malek Shah.</p>

<p>The eleventh century was a period when the nations
of Western Europe were beginning to crystallize
both as regards their governments and civilization.
Their influence was felt at home and
abroad, although the masses were still in the depths
of barbarism. Among the clergy and nobility
something of order and civilization, and social development
had appeared, but we are told by one
writer that it was a striking characteristic of the
time to find side by side with barbarian violence
and disorder, and the constant display of the most
brutal passions, a strong religious feeling. This
feeling often took the form of superstition and
fanaticism, the performance of meritorious works,
especially a pilgrimage to the holy sepulcher.
Thousands risked their life and health, and spent
all their fortune to reach the holy city, with the
same devotion and sacrifice which we still witness
among the ardent Russian pilgrims of to-day.</p>

<p>When Asia Minor and Syria were conquered by
the Turks this access to Jerusalem was cut off. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
1076 (Al-Ghazali was then eighteen years old)
they massacred three thousand of these Christian
people and their subsequent rule was relentless in
its tyranny. We read that “the venerable Patriarch
was dragged by the hair along the streets, and
cast into a dungeon; the clergy of every sect were
insulted; and the unhappy pilgrims were made to
suffer every indignity and abuse.”</p>

<p>This treatment of Christian pilgrims produced a
storm of indignation and anger throughout the
West. Peter the Hermit himself visited Jerusalem
and returned to Europe to arouse the nations. The
result was the first Crusade, in which Pope Urban
II coöperated. Three hundred thousand half-armed,
half-naked peasants forced their way across
Europe along the Rhine and the Danube. Only
one-third of their number reached the shores of
Asia. There they were utterly destroyed and
only a pyramid of bones remained to tell of their
fate.</p>

<p>The Crusade under Godfrey of Bouillon was a
well-appointed military expedition embracing the
flower of Europe. There are said to have been
mustered in the plains of Bithynia one hundred
thousand horsemen in full armour and six hundred
thousand footmen. These numbers may be exaggerated,
and pestilence and famine thinned their
ranks, but in less than three years they had attained
the great object of their expedition. In 1097 they
laid siege to Nicea and captured it. They advanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
against Antioch and after seven weary
months laid siege to the city. In 1099 they advanced
on Jerusalem and after a siege of forty days
the holy city surrendered. “The merciless Franks
did not fail to inflict a terrible vengeance for their
own sufferings and the indignities which had been
heaped upon their religion and their race. The
Jews were burned in their synagogues; and seventy
thousand Moslems were put to the sword. For
three days the city was given up to indiscriminate
pillage and massacre, until a pestilence was bred by
the putrefaction of the slain.”</p>

<p>Soon Godfrey and his successors extended their
dominions until only four cities, Aleppo, Damascus,
Hamath, and Hums remained in the possession
of the Moslems in Syria. Everywhere the followers
of the Prophet were filled with grief and
shame and with a great longing to wipe away the
disgrace which had fallen on their religion.</p>

<p>“In the year 492 <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span>,” says Muir,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> “consternation
was spread throughout the land by the capture
of Jerusalem, and cruel treatment of its inhabitants.
Preachers went about proclaiming the
sad story, kindling revenge, and rousing men to
recover from infidel hands the Mosque of Omar,
and scene of the Prophet’s heavenly flight. But
whatever the success elsewhere, the mission failed
in the East, which was occupied with its own troubles,
and moreover cared little for the Holy Land,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
dominated as it then was by the Fatimide faith.
Crowds of exiles, driven for refuge to Bagdad, and
joined there by the populace, cried out for war
against the Franks. But neither Sultan nor Caliph
had ears to hear. For two Fridays the insurgents,
with this cry, stormed the Great Mosque, broke the
pulpit and throne of the Caliph in pieces, and
shouted down the service; but that was all. No
army went.”</p>

<p>Among Moslems themselves religious rancour
abounded. At present the four orthodox sects
worship together and live in peace as neighbours,
but in those days there were frequent and hot disputes
between the rival schools and much controversial
literature arose, so that the hatred between
the sects was deep and bitter. The Persian historian,
Mirkhond, has recorded a fact which shows
how implacable the feeling had become towards the
close of the Caliphate. When the Mongols of
Genghiz Khan appeared before the city of Rei, they
found it divided into two factions—the one composed
of Shafiʾites, the other of Hanifites. The
former at once entered into secret negotiations undertaking
to deliver up the city at night, on condition
that the Mongols massacred the members of
the other sect. The Mongols, never reluctant to
shed blood, gladly accepted these proposals, and
being admitted into the city, slaughtered the
Hanifites without mercy.</p>

<p>It was in this atmosphere of mutual hatred, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
war and bloodshed, that Al-Ghazali spent the last
years of his life. We may excuse in him much of
what would otherwise seem intolerant and hateful,
when we remember how the passion of war blinds
human judgment and makes it impossible to see
any virtue in the invader.</p>

<p>We must not forget that Al-Ghazali came into
close touch with Oriental Christians from his boyhood.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Christianity was established in Persia at
the time of the Moslem conquest, and the Nestorian
Church withstood its terrific impact when Zoroastrianism
was almost destroyed. The coming of
the Arabs meant to the Christians only a change of
masters. The Nestorians became the <i>rayah</i>, “people
of protection,” of the Caliphs. They did not
immediately sink into their present deplorable condition.
They still conducted foreign missions
and during the entire Abbasside period remained
a very important factor of civilization in the East.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
They were permitted to restore their Churches, but
not to build new ones; they were forbidden to bear
arms or ride a horse, save in case of necessity, and
they even then had to dismount on meeting a Moslem;
they were subject to the usual poll-tax. Yet
the Nestorians were the most powerful non-Moslem
community while the Caliphs reigned at Bagdad
(750-1258), and had a higher tradition of
civilization than their masters. They were used at
court as physicians, scribes, and secretaries, and
thus gained great influence, having much freedom
in canonical matters, elected Patriarchs, etc. The
Arab scholarship which came to Spain, and was a
great factor in mediæval learning, begins in great
part with the Nestorians of Bagdad. They handed
on to their Arab masters the Greek culture which
was inherited in Syriac translations. So we find
the Caliphs treating them as chief of the Christian
communities, and at times civil authority over all
Christians had been given to the Nestorian Patriarch.</p>

<p>Early in the eleventh century Al-Biruni, a Moslem
writer from Khiva, mentions the Nestorians as
the most civilized of the Christian communities
under the Caliph. He says that there are three
sects of Christians—Melchites, Nestorians and Jacobites.
“The most numerous of them are the
Melchites and Nestorians; because Greece and the
adjacent countries are all inhabited by Melchites,
whilst the majority of the inhabitants of Syria,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Irak and Mesopotamia and Khorasan are Nestorians.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Al-Ghazali spent his first twenty years in Khorasan.
Did he ever become acquainted with Christianity
through perusal of the Gospel? We know
that Arabic, if not Persian, translations existed at
this period; and not only are there many references
to Christ and His teaching in Al-Ghazali’s works,
but there are some very few passages accurate
enough to be called quotations. He himself states
as we shall see later: “I have read in the Gospel.”</p>

<p>That there were translations of the Bible into
Arabic to which Al-Ghazali may have had access is
probable. Dr. Kilgour tells of Arabic Gospel manuscripts
of the ninth century and of translations of
the Old Testament and portions of the New made
in the Fayyoum before 942 <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> “To the tenth
century belong versions of some books of the Old
Testament from Syriac, others from the LXX.,
and from the Coptic; and some fresh translations
of the Pentateuch, using the Samaritan text as well
as the Massoretic.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Diglot manuscripts in Syriac and Arabic are
quite numerous. The manuscript of the four Gospels,
of which a few leaves are now in the British
Museum, is a good specimen of such a diglot. It
was brought by Tischendorf from the Syrian Convent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
of St. Mary Deipara in the Nitrian Desert.
In the early part of the eleventh century an Arabic
scholar made a version of Tatian’s Diatessaron,
that early Syriac Harmony of the Gospels which
helped the Christian Church to realize the main
facts concerning our Saviour. A version of the
Psalms was prepared in the middle of the same
century for use in the Church services of the papal
or Melchite Greeks. This was translated from
the Greek Psalter, and, from the place where it was
first printed, became known afterwards as the
Aleppo Psalter.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It remains an interesting question
whether Al-Ghazali in his travels, or while still
in Khorasan, ever examined the New Testament.</p>

<p>We are told that the Jews translated their law
into Persian by 827 <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> It is, therefore, hard to
acquit the Christians of Persia of negligence.
Their bishops found time to write learned treatises
in Persian and Arabic, and even to translate Aristotle,
but not to give Moslems the Scriptures. Yet
Al-Kindi and others like him, many of whose
names and writings are lost, were not afraid to give
their testimony even at the court of the Caliphs.
“The Church,” says W. T. Whiteley,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> “had not
failed to exercise an influence on Islam around it,
while Christians might not, on peril of death, seek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
to win converts direct, a command occasionally
violated with honour and success, yet all the development
of Islam at Damascus and Bagdad was in
a Christian atmosphere.”</p>

<p>The Christianity of that period was, however,
not the religion of Christ in its purity nor after the
example of His love and toleration. Mutual hatred
and suspicion prevented real intercourse of those
who, as devout Christians and devout Moslems,
were both seeking God. The Moslem was feared
and the Christian despised. The followers of
Jesus were the enemies of Allah in the eyes of
Moslems.</p>

<p>How Christians were regarded at this time we
may learn from the books of canon law of this
period, and that immediately following upon it.
They were considered <i>infidels</i> in the Moslem sense
of the word, and were protected only by the payment
of a poll tax, which gave them certain rights
as subjects. The most distinguished jurist of the
Shafiʾite sect, An-Nawawi, who taught at Damascus
in 1267, lays down the law<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> as follows: “An
infidel who has to pay his poll tax should be treated
by the tax collector with disdain; the collector remaining
seated and the infidel standing before him,
the head bent and the body bowed. The infidel
should personally place the money in the balance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
while the collector holds him by the beard and
strikes him upon both cheeks. Infidels should be
forbidden to have houses higher than those of their
Moslem neighbours, or even to have them as high;
a rule, however, that does not apply to the infidels
who inhabit a separate quarter. An infidel subject
of our Sovereign may not ride a horse; but a donkey
or a mule is permitted him, whatever may be its
value. He must use an <i>ikaf</i>, and wooden spurs,
those of iron being forbidden him, as well as a
saddle. He must go to the side of the road to let
a Moslem pass. He must not be treated as a person
of importance, nor given the first place at a
gathering. He should be distinguished by a suit
of coloured cloth and a girdle outside his clothes.
If he enters a bathing house where there are Moslems,
or if he undresses anywhere else in their
presence, the infidel should wear round his neck an
iron or leaden necklace, or some other mark of
servitude.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> He is forbidden to offend Moslems,
either by making them hear his false doctrines, or
by speaking aloud of Esdras or of the Messiah, or
by ostentatiously drinking wine or eating pork.
And infidels are forbidden to sound the bells of
their churches or of their synagogues, or celebrate
ostentatiously their sacrilegious rites.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>“The history of Christian communities,” says
Margoliouth,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> “under Moslem rule cannot be adequately
written; the members of those communities
had no opportunity of describing their condition
safely, and the Moslems naturally devote little
space to their concerns. Generally speaking, they
seem to have been regarded as certain old Greek
and Roman sages regarded women: as a necessary
annoyance. Owing to their being unarmed their
prosperity was always hazardous; and though it is
true that this was the case with all the subjects of a
despotic state under an irresponsible ruler, the non-Moslem
population was at the mercy of the mob as
well as of the sovereign; they were likely scapegoats
whenever there was distress, and even in the
best governed countries periods of distress frequently
arose.”</p>

<p>There are darker shades in the treatment of
Christians and in the moral condition of this period
over which one might well draw the veil, but some
of the chapters of Ghazali’s <i>Ihya</i> reflect such terrible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
conditions as Margoliouth describes: “A
form of passion which is nameless would appear at
one time to have been as familiar among Moslems
as of old among Hellenes. Christian lads seem
often to have been the unhappy objects of this passion.
A story is told us by the biographer Yakut
of a young monk of Edessa or Urfah who had the
misfortune to attract the fancy of one Saʾad the
copyist. The visits and attentions of this Moslem
became so offensive that the monks had to put a
stop to them. Thereupon this personage pined
away, and was finally found dead outside the monastery
wall. The Moslem population declared that
the monks had killed him, and the governor proposed
to execute and burn the young monk who
had occasioned the disaster, and scourge his colleagues.
They finally got off by paying a sum of
100,000 dirhems.”</p>

<p>Not only among Moslems, however, but among
Christians as well, morals were at a low ebb in the
eleventh century. One of the annalists of the
Roman Church says it was an iron age barren of
all goodness, a leaden age abounding in all wickedness.
“Christ was then, as it appears, in a very
deep sleep, when the ship was covered with waves;
and what seemed worse, when the Lord was thus
asleep, there were no disciples, who by their cries
might awaken him, being themselves all fast
asleep.”</p>

<p>Enemies of the Papacy have perhaps exaggerated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
the vices and crimes of the popes in this and the
preceding century; but the Church, on the testimony
of its own writers, was immersed in profaneness,
sensuality, and lewdness. When Otho I,
Emperor of Germany, came to Rome, he introduced
moral reforms by the power of the sword,
but according to Milner,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> “The effect of Otho’s
regulations was that the popes exchanged the vices
of the rake and the debauchee for those of the
ambitious politician and the hypocrite; and gradually
recovered, by a prudent conduct, the domineering
ascendency, which had been lost by vicious excesses.
But this did not begin to take place till
the latter end of the eleventh century.”</p>

<p>Missionary effort in this century was confined to
work in Hungary, the unevangelized portions of
Denmark, Poland, and Prussia. Adam of Bremen,
who wrote in 1080, says: “Look at the very
ferocious nation of the Danes. For a long time
they have been accustomed, in the praises of God,
to resound Alleluia. Look at that piratical people.
They are now content with the fruits of their own
country. Look at that horrid region, formerly
altogether inaccessible on account of idolatry; they
now eagerly admit the preachers of the word.”</p>

<p>The Prussians continued pagans in a great measure
throughout this century. We read that eighteen
missionaries sent out to labour among them were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
massacred. They seemed to have been among the
last of the European nations to submit to the yoke
of Christ.</p>

<p>The noblest figure of the century in the West, in
the annals of Christendom, was undoubtedly that
of Anselm. He was born about the time of Al-Ghazali,
and died in 1109. His life in many respects
is a parallel to that of his contemporary.
Both were theologians and both were mystics, seeking
rest for their souls in withdrawing from the
world and its allurements. Both were apologists
for the Faith and opponents of infidelity and philosophy.
Both exerted an immense influence by their
writings as well as through teaching; and if Al-Ghazali
sought the revival of religious life in Islam
through his <i>Ihya</i>, Anselm gave employment to his
active mind in writing his celebrated treatise “<i>Cur
Deus Homo?</i>” Both of them refuted philosophers
in their effort to establish the Faith.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note in this connection that
Anselm’s famous book is now used in Arabic translation
by missionaries to Moslems, and that Al-Ghazali’s
“Confessions” have been put into the
hands of the English reader as a testimony of his
sincerity and devotion.</p>

<p>Both Anselm and Al-Ghazali lived and wrote
under a deep consciousness of the world to come,
the terrors of the judgment day, and the doom of
the wicked. This also was characteristic of the
times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>To understand the time in which Al-Ghazali
lived we must also remember that it was one of
great literary activity under the Abbasside Caliphs
of Bagdad and the Seljuk sultans. We have seen
how rulers rewarded literary genius, established
schools, and furthered education on religious lines.
Arabic literature affords a galaxy of names during
the latter half of the eleventh century in almost
every department of Moslem learning.</p>

<p>Among Ghazali’s celebrated contemporaries,
men of literary fame, we may mention Abiwardi
(d. 1113), the poet; Ibn Al-Khayyat, who was
born at Damascus in 1058 and died in Persia in
1125; Al-Ghazi (b. 1049), who composed elegies
and panegyrics at Nizamiyya College, was a college
mate of Ghazali’s, and died in Khorasan; Al-Tarabalusi
(b. 1080), a younger contemporary.
But the most famous poet of all was Al-Hariri
(1054-1122), whose “Assemblies” throw so much
light on the manners and morals of this period.
Among the men at the Nizamiyya University were
Al-Khatîb (b. 1030), the great philologist; and
Ibn Al-Arabi, born at Seville in 1076, who visited
Bagdad to attend the teaching of Al-Ghazali. The
greatest of all the Shafiʾite doctors, Al-Ruyani, was
also a contemporary of Al-Ghazali. He taught at
Nishapur and wrote the most voluminous book on
jurisprudence in existence, called “The Sea of
Doctrine.” In 1108, just as he had finished one of
his lectures he was murdered by a fanatic of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Assassin sect, who were then holding the castle of
Alamut in the mountains. We must also mention
a schoolmate of Al-Ghazali, Al-Harrasi (1058-1110),
who studied at Nishapur under the Imam
Al-Haramain, was made his assistant, and then
went to Bagdad, where he taught theology in the
Nizamiyya University for the rest of his life. Nor
must we forget Al-Baghawi, who wrote a famous
commentary on the Koran, and other works of theology
(1122); Al-Raghib Al-Ispahani, who died
in 1108, and wrote a dictionary of the Koran, arranged
in alphabetical order, called <i>Mufradat alfaz
Al-Koran</i>, with quotations from the traditions and
from the poets; he also wrote a treatise on morals,
which Al-Ghazali always carried about with him
(<i>Kitab ad-dharia</i>), and a commentary on the
Koran. Among the early contemporaries of Al-Ghazali
we must not forget to mention Ali bin
ʾUthman Al-Jullabi Al-Hujwiri, the author of the
oldest Persian treatise on Sufism extant. He was
born in Ghazni, Afghanistan, and died in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1062,
when Al-Ghazali was fourteen years old. Al-Hujwiri
travelled far and wide through the
Mohammedan Empire and his famous work
<i>Kashf al-Mahjub</i> anticipates much of the teaching
of Al-Ghazali, who must have been familiar with
this author. And to complete this already long
list of celebrities, we may mention Al-Maidani of
Nishapur, who died in 1124, having written a
great work on Arabic proverbs; Al-Zamakhshari,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
born in 1074, who wrote a famous commentary
on the Koran; Ibn Tumart, the noted philosopher
of the West who attended Al-Ghazali’s lectures at
Nizamiyya; and ash-Shahristani who wrote on the
various religions and sects—the standard work
among all Moslems to-day on comparative religion.
The period was in many respects the
golden age of Islamic literature, and it is high
praise indeed that, in the judgment of Moslem and
Christian, Al-Ghazali surpassed all his literary
contemporaries, if not in style and eloquence, at
least in the scope and character of his writings—still
more by the enduring and outreaching influence
of his life. The story of that life and the
character of his message we will now attempt to
sketch for the reader.</p>

<p>“Ghazali is without doubt the most remarkable
figure in all Islam. His doctrine is the expression of
his own personality. He abandoned the attempt to
understand this world. But the religious problem he
comprehended much more profoundly than did the
philosophers of his time. These were intellectual in
their methods, like their Greek predecessors, and
consequently regarded the doctrines of Religion as
merely the products of the conception or fancy or
even caprice of the lawgiver. According to them
Religion was either blind obedience, or a kind of
knowledge which contained truth of an inferior order.</p>

<p>“On the other hand Ghazali represents Religion as
the experience of his inner Being. It is for him
more than law and more than Doctrine; it is the
Soul’s experience.”</p>

<p class="right">—<i>“Philosophy in Islam,” T. J. DeBoer.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<h3>II<br>
BIRTH AND EDUCATION</h3>

<p>As already stated, Al-Ghazali was born and
educated in Khorasan, Persia, and there
also he spent the closing years of his life.
Persia, as Huart expresses it, possessed “an intangible
force, the Aryan genius, the powerful,
imaginative, and creative mind of the great Indo-European
family, the artistic, philosophic, and intellectual
brain which, from the Abbasside period onward,
so mightily affected Arab literature, enabling
it to develop in every quarter of the Caliph’s realms,
and to produce the enormous aggregate of works.”
It was this Aryan genius which explains much of
the powerful influence of Al-Ghazali upon Moslem
thought, and the revival of that influence in our
day when Islam is again facing disintegrating
forces. At the time of Al-Ghazali, Persian influence
was supreme. It pervaded everything.
The Arabs had ceased to write. The realms of
poetry, theology, and science, were dominated by
those of Persian birth. All posts, administrative
and legal, were held by men who were not Arabs,
and yet the language they used was that of the
Koran, and remained the sole literary language of
the huge empire of the Caliphs. “All races, Persians,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Syrians, Berbers from Maghrib, were melted
and amalgamated in this mighty crucible.”</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali was a Persian by birth, an Aryan in
his modes of thought, a Semite in his religion and
he became a cosmopolitan by travel and education.
His long residence in all the great centres of Islam
of his day brought him into close touch with men
of every school of thought and followers of all
manners of religions and philosophies. When we
remember this, we have the key to his enormous
literary productiveness. His horizon stretched
from Afghanistan to Spain, and from Kurdistan
to Southern Arabia. What happened outside the
<i>Dar ul Islam</i> in infidel Europe was brought to the
notice of all by the Crusades.</p>

<p>Men of learning had intercourse by correspondence
with those of similar tastes in every part of
the Moslem world. We have records of letters received
by Al-Ghazali from Spain and Morocco as
well as from Egypt, Syria, and Palestine. Questions
of jurisprudence, philosophy, and theology
were referred by Sultans to celebrated authorities
for reply. All this produced the cosmopolitan atmosphere
we find in his works.</p>

<p>The poet Moore describes Al-Ghazali’s native
land as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“... the delightful Province of the Sun,</div>

<p>Khorasan, indeed, signifies “the land of the
sun,” and was one of the four geographical divisions
into which the ancient kingdom of the Sassanians
was divided. They were named according
to the cardinal points of the compass. After the
Arab conquests the name was used both for a
definite province and also in a looser sense for the
whole eastern region of Persia. Even now the
boundaries of the province are scarcely determined.
The total area is about 150,000 square miles, and
the present population not over 800,000. It was
doubtless far more in Al-Ghazali’s day.</p>

<p>Towards the north and southwest Khorasan is
mountainous. In the east the country is hilly, but
between the mountain ranges there extend broad
tracts of waste land. By far the most extensive
of these saline wastes is the Dasht-i-Kabir, or Great
Salt Desert of Khorasan. Throughout the province,
and especially near Tus, the arid plains and
the grassy valleys have been engaged in a perpetual
struggle for the mastery. The shifting sands have
already absorbed some towns and villages. There
are scarcely any rivers, and the few streams are
brackish and intermittent, losing themselves in the
great salt desert. The salt brought down by the
rivers is deposited in the marshes. The fierce
summer heat dries these up until the winter floods
occur again. This process being repeated for ages,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
in the course of time the whole stretch of soil over
which the marsh extends has become incrusted
with salt.</p>

<p>Travellers and students of climate seem to be
agreed that the country offers unmistakable evidence
of desiccation. Ruins of cities and villages
are incredibly numerous and point to a larger population
and better climate and irrigation in the days
past. It would not be just to attribute the decay
of Persia entirely to the devastations of war and
the misrule of Islam.</p>

<p>“A comparison of the four provinces of Khorasan,
Azerbaijan, Kirman, and Seyistan is instructive,”
says Ellsworth Huntington.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Khorasan “has
suffered from war more severely than has any
other province of Persia. Its northern portion,
where the rainfall is heaviest, and where the greatest
amount of fighting has taken place, is to-day
one of the most prosperous portions of Persia. It
contains numerous ruins, but they are by no means
such impressive features as are those farther south.
The southern and drier part of the province is full
of ruins, and has suffered great depopulation.
Azerbaijan, which ... has suffered from war
more than any province except Khorasan, is the
most prosperous and thickly settled part of Persia.
The relative abundance of its water supply renders
its future hopeful. Seyistan has suffered from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
wars, but less severely than the two preceding provinces.
Nevertheless, it has been depopulated to a
far greater extent. Its extreme aridity renders
recovery well-nigh impossible, except along the
Helmund. Kirman lies so remote behind its barriers
of desert and mountains that it has suffered
from war much less than any of the three other
provinces. Yet its ruined cities and its appearance
of hopeless depopulation are almost as impressive
as those of Seyistan. If war and misgovernment
are the cause of the decay of Persia, it is remarkable
that the two provinces which have suffered
most from war, and not less from misgovernment,
should now be the most prosperous and least depopulated;
while the two which have suffered less
from war and no more from misgovernment have
been fearfully, and, it would seem, irreparably
depopulated.”</p>

<p>The surface of the province of Khorasan to-day
consists mainly of highlands, the saline deserts, and
the fruitful well-watered upland valleys. In these
fruitful regions rice, cotton, saffron, but especially
melons and other fruits, are raised in profusion.
Other products are manna, gum, asafœtida for export
to India, and turquois. The chief manufactures
have always been sabres, pottery, carpets,
woolen and cotton goods.</p>

<p>The town of Mashad, the present capital of
Khorasan, has supplanted the older city and district
of Tus, which was an ancient capital. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
ruins of this city lie fifteen miles to the northwest.
As early as the tenth century we have references
to the birthplace of Al-Ghazali. Thus Misʾar
Muhalhil (about 941 <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>) writes: “Tus is made
up of the union of four towns, two of which are
large and the other two of minor importance; its
area is a square mile. It has beautiful monuments
that date from the time of Islam, such as the house
of Hamid, son of Kahtabah, the tomb of Ali, son
of Musa, and that of Rashid in the environs (lit.
gardens) of the town.” Istakhri (951 <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>),
writing ten years later, speaks of Tus as a dependency
with four large towns or settlements. He
says: “Taking Tus as a dependency of the province
of Nishapur, its towns are Radkan, Tabaran,
Bazdghur, and Naukan, in which (latter) is the
tomb of Ali, son of Musa ar-Riza (may the peace
of God be upon him), and the tomb of Haroun
ar-Rashîd.... The tomb of Ar-Riza is about
one-quarter of a <i>farsakh</i> distant towards the village
called Sanabadh.” The best summary of the
history of Tus and description of its present condition
is given by Professor A. V. Williams Jackson
in his most interesting book, “From Constantinople
to the Home of Omar Khayyam.” He tells
us that the name of the town is as old as the half-legendary
warrior Tusa of the Avesta, who gave
battle against Turan. Alexander the Great
passed through it in pursuit of Bessus, the slayer
of the last Darius. During the Zoroastrian sway,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
the city of Tus shared with Nishapur the distinction
of being the seat of a Nestorian Christian
bishop. When the Arab conquest of Persia came
Tus fell before the invaders and it became a great
Moslem centre, famous especially as the home of
the poet Firdausi, who was born there about 935
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> and died 1025 <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span></p>

<p>Professor Jackson thus describes the present
ruined condition of the city: “The crumbling walls
of the dead city were once broad and lofty ramparts
of clay and rubble, much like those already
mentioned at Bustam and Rei, but they had become
much flattened with the lapse of ages, although
traces of their towers were still to be seen,
while their outline showed the contour of the town,
which must have formed a very irregular quadrilateral,
following roughly the points of the compass....
The scene, as we saw it, presented
a strange paradox of the destructive effects of the
hand of man, and the eternal power of nature to
rise and bloom again. The devastating inroads of
the Ghuzz hordes and the Mongol armies, aided
by earthquakes, had indeed laid mighty Tus in
ruins: but its dust still contains the resurrection
seed of flowers and grain, bringing life anew in
the midst of death. Acres of barley and fields of
thick clover spread their rich green on all sides, in
contrast with stretches of arid waste that told only
too well the story of ruin wrought in the past.”
Professor Jackson goes on to say: “It is clear that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
the ruined site of Tus we have been examining,
with the Rudbar and Rizan Gates, formed part of
the borough of Tabaran, an important section of
the town in Firdausi’s day, when the city covered
a large area comprising several thickly populated
centres, as we know from the Oriental geographers
of the tenth century, or the period covering the
better portion of the poet’s life. It was in
Tabaran that Al-Ghazali was buried, and there he
must have had his home during the closing years
of his life.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Religious disputation must have been the very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
atmosphere of Tus. Christians were numerous
and the Moslem <i>Shiahs</i> were almost as strong as
the orthodox. Some of their most celebrated
writers and scholars, for example Abu Jaʾfar
Muhammed, were born at Tus; and Ibn Abi Hatim,
one of the earliest and most important critics of the
science of Tradition, died at Tus in 939. In spite
of its learned men, however, Tus did not have a
high reputation, as we know from the following
anecdote related of Ibn-Habbariyya. He was
asked by an enemy of Nizam Al-Mulk to compose
a satire on this ruler. “How can I attack a man
to whose kindness I owe everything I see in my
house?” asked the poet. However, on being
pressed, he penned these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What wonder is it that Nizam Al-Mulk should rule,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that Fate should be on his side?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fortune is like the water-wheel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which raises water from the well—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">None but <i>oxen</i> can turn it!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">When the vizier was informed of this attack upon
him, he merely remarked that the poet had simply
intended to allude to his origin—he came from Tus
in Khorasan, and, according to a popular saying,
all the men of Tus were oxen (one would say asses,
nowadays).</p>

<p>“The people of Khorasan,” says Chenery, “were
renowned for their stinginess, and it is not surprising
that the inhabitants of the mother town<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
were said to excel in it all the rest of the world.
Witness the story, related in Saʾadi’s Gulistan, if I
remember well, of the merchant of Merv, who
would not allow his son to eat cheese, but made
him rub his bread against the glass cover under
which it was kept.”</p>

<p>To prove the stupidity of the Khorasanis to-day,
Major P. M. Sykes<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> tells a story of three Persians
who met and were all praising their own provinces.
The Kermani said, “Kerman produces fruit of
seven colours.” The Shirazi continued, “The
waters of Ruknabad issue from the very rock.”
But the poor Khorasani could only say, “From
Khorasan come all the fools like myself.”</p>

<p>Yet Khorasan, in the words of Hujwiri, was that
land “where the shadow of God’s favour rested,”
as regards the teaching of the Mystics. He mentions
nine leading Sufis who belong to Khorasan,
and taught there before Al-Ghazali’s day, all of
them distinguished for the “sublimity of their
aspiration, the eloquence of their discourse, and
the sagacity of their intelligence.” He then goes
on to say: “It would be difficult to mention all the
sheikhs of Khorasan. I have met three hundred
in that province alone who had such mystical endowments
that a single man of them would have
been enough for the whole world. This is due to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
the fact that the sun of love and the fortune of the
Sufi Path is in the ascendant in Khorasan.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>In view of such statements it is clear that Al-Ghazali
owed much to his environment as well as
to his own genius. He did not originate mysticism,
but used what his predecessors had already written
on the subject. The very chapter headings of
<i>Kashf al-Mahjub</i> are the same as those found in
Al-Ghazali’s books on mysticism.</p>

<p>According to Murtadha (who follows As-Subqi),
Al-Ghazali’s full name was Abu Hamid Mohammed
bin Mohammed bin Mohammed at-Tusi al-Ghazali,
and he was born at Tus in the year of
the Hegira 450 (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1058). In regard to his
name, it is related that others before him had the
peculiarity of the family name three times repeated.
“Ibn-Kutaibah states that Abu’l-Bakhtari’s
name was Wahb b. Wahb b. Wahb, the same
name thrice in one continuation; and that similar
to this among the names of the Persian kings was
that of Bahram b. Bahram b. Bahram; among the
Talibis (the descendants of Abu-Talib) that of
Hasan b. Hasan b. Hasan, and among the Ghassan
that of al-Harith the junior b. al-Harith and the
senior b. al-Harith.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Concerning the spelling of his name, whether it
should be spelled with two z’s or with one, there
has been long and strong dispute. Professor Macdonald<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
thinks the name should be spelt <i>Ghazzali</i>
and has given his arguments in a special essay.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
This spelling is given by Ibn Khallikan in his
biographical dictionary (d. <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1282). But apparently,
according to the authority of As-Samʾani,
the name is derived from Ghazala, a village near
Tus, and is not a professional noun, such as are
common among patronymics. Abu Saʾd ʾAbd al-Karim
As-Samʾani was born only two years after
Al-Ghazali’s death, and wrote a famous book of
patronymics in eight volumes. He was, therefore,
an expert in names and genealogies, and we may
well accept his authority for the spelling of the
name of the great <i>imam</i>, who was his own countryman.
The sheikhs of the Azhar University in
Cairo <i>all</i> follow this authority and write <i>Al-Ghazali</i>.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>Some say that there had already been two
scholars in the family, one an elder Al-Ghazali, at
whose tomb in the cemetery of Tus prayer was answered.
This was a paternal uncle of Ghazali’s
father. The other was a son of the same. The
story is told, apparently on the authority of Ghazali
himself, that at the time of his father’s death he
committed his two boys, Mohammed and Ahmed,
to the care of a trusted Sufi friend for their education.
He himself seems to have had unfulfilled desires
in regard to his own education and was determined
that his boys should have a better opportunity.
So he left in trust what money he had for
the purpose with this friend, who proved faithful
and taught and cared for them until the money was
all gone. Then he advised them to go to a
<i>madrasa</i>, where, according to Moslem custom, they
would receive food for their need and shelter.
Ghazali used to tell the story of this experience in
after life, and would add the remark, “We became
students for the sake of something else than God,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
but <i>He</i> was unwilling that it should be for the sake
of anything but Himself.” This instance doubtless
throws light on the motives for his studies and
his great diligence. At the outset he was in search
rather of reputation and wealth through learning
than of piety.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Of Al-Ghazali’s home life at Tus, and of his own
family life afterwards, we know next to nothing.
His name Abu Hamid was doubtless given him
much later, and would seem to indicate that he had
a son of that name who probably died in infancy.
We know that he married before he was twenty
and that at least three daughters survived him.
Of his younger brother, however, who died fifteen
years after he did (1126), and was buried at
Kazvin, we know the following: He succeeded
Al-Ghazali in the professorial chair at the Nizamiyya
School. Like him, he was a mystic and
preached his views with great eloquence as well as
with a prolific pen. We are told that he was a
man of splendid appearance, and had the gift of
healing. So fond was he of public preaching that
he neglected his judicial studies. He wrote an
abridgement of his brother’s great work, and also
a celebrated treatise on mysticism called <i>Minhaj
al-albab</i> (Path for Hearts), in which he deals
with the advantages of poverty, and advocates the
wearing of a special garb by the dervishes. Another
of his books was in defense of music, called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
<i>Bawariq al-ilma</i>; but this was considered frivolous
by strict Moslems, although the Sufis used music
to produce the state of ecstasy.</p>

<p>Of Al-Ghazali’s mother we know nothing beyond
the fact that she survived her husband and
lived to see both her sons famous at Bagdad,
whither apparently she accompanied or followed
them. An interesting story is told of how, when
Abu Hamid was at the height of his fame at
Bagdad, his brother Ahmed not merely failed to
show him proper respect, but acted in such a manner
as to discredit him in the eyes of the people.
The full account is worth giving. “He had a
brother called Ahmed, surnamed Jamal-ud-Din, or,
as others say, Zain-ud-Din, who, notwithstanding
the high rank which his brother held, would not
take part with him in the prayers (<i>i. e.</i>, would not
recognize him as a man fitted to lead the public
prayers), even while thousands of the commonalty
and nobility arranged themselves in ranks behind
him. So he complained to his mother what he experienced
at his brother’s hands, (saying) that it
almost led to people doubting him, seeing that his
brother was celebrated for his good conduct and
piety, and he asked his mother to order him
(Ahmed) to treat him as other people did. He
complained about this repeatedly, and pressed his
demand. His mother urged him (Ahmed) time
and again to agree to this, and he agreed on condition
that he stand apart from the ranks. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Imam accepted this condition, and when one of the
appointed times of prayer arrived, the Imam went
to the Mosque, and the people followed him, till,
when the Imam began the prayer, and the people
began it after him, Jamal-ud-Din followed him in
the prayer in the distance. And while they were
praying Jamal-ud-Din suddenly interrupted him.
So this trial was worse than the first; and when he
was asked the reason (of his conduct) he replied
that it was impossible for him to take as his pattern
an Imam whose heart was full of blood, indicating
by this expression the vileness of one who
took a share in the work of worldly men of learning.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Al-Ghazali must have begun his education at a
very early age, and his studies at Tus met with
such success that he went to the larger educational
centre of Jurjan before the age of twenty, a distance
of over one hundred miles, and no inconsiderable
journey at that time.</p>

<p>In Al-Ghazali’s autobiography we have a
glimpse of how he himself conceived the growth of
a child in wisdom and stature. “The first sense
revealed to man,” he says, “is touch, by means of
which he perceives a certain group of qualities—heat,
cold, moist, dry. The sense of touch does
not perceive colours and forms, which are for it
as though they did not exist. Next comes the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
sense of sight, which makes him acquainted with
colours and forms; that is to say, with that which
occupies the highest rank in the world of sensation.
The sense of hearing succeeds, and then the senses
of smell and taste. When the human being
can elevate himself above the world of sense,
towards the age of seven, he receives the faculty
of discrimination; he enters then upon a new
phase of existence and can experience, thanks to
this faculty, impressions, superior to those of the
senses, which do not occur in the sphere of sensation.”</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali must have been an early riser from
his youth. In his “Beginner’s Guide to Religion
and Morals” (Al Badayet) he writes: “When you
awaken from sleep, endeavour to arise before early
dawn, and may the first thing that enters your
heart and your tongue be the remembrance of God
Most High, saying, ‘Thanks be to God who hath
given us life after the death of sleep. To Him do
we return. He hath awakened us and awakened
all nature. The greatness and the power belong to
God; the majesty and the dominion to the Lord of
the worlds. He hath awakened us to the religion
of Islam and the testimony of His unity, and the
religion of His Prophet Mohammed and the sect
of our father Abraham, who was a <i>Hanif</i> and a
Moslem, and not a polytheist. O God, I ask Thee
that Thou wouldst this day send me all good and
deliver me from all evil. By Thee, O God, do we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
arise from sleep, and by Thee do we reach the even-tide.
In Thee do we live and die and to Thee do
we return.’ And when you put on your garments,
remember that God desires you to cover your
nakedness with them and to show forth God’s
beauty to those around you.”</p>

<p>In another place in the same little volume he
again inculcates early rising by saying: “Know
that the night and the day consist of twenty-four
hours. Let therefore your sleep during the night
and day be not more than eight hours; for it will
suffice you to think after you have lived sixty
years that you have lost twenty years of it solely
in sleep.”</p>

<p>He probably began to read even before the age
of seven, for we find that his studies at Tus, and
afterwards at Jurjan, apparently included not only
religious science but also a thorough knowledge of
Persian and Arabic. Of his religious studies we
will speak later. He himself tells us that the
philosophical sciences taught included “mathematics,
logic, physics, metaphysics, politics, and
moral philosophy.” And although he does not
speak in his Confessions of his earliest studies,
what he says in regard to mathematics throws a
flood of light on his youthful scepticism. He says,
“Mathematics comprises the knowledge of calculation,
geometry, and cosmography: it has no connection
with the religious sciences, and proves nothing
for or against religion; it rests on a foundation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
of proofs which, once known and understood, cannot
be refuted. Mathematics tend, however, to
produce two bad results. The first is this: Whoever
studies this science admires the subtlety and clearness
of its proofs. His confidence in philosophy
increases, and he thinks that all its departments
are capable of the same clearness and solidity of
proofs as mathematics. But when he hears people
speak of the unbelief and impiety of mathematicians,
of their professed disregard for the divine
Law, which is notorious, it is true that, out of
regard for authority, he echoes these accusations,
but he says to himself at the same time that, if
there was truth in religion, it would not have
escaped those who have displayed so much keenness
of intellect in the study of mathematics.”</p>

<p>Next, when he becomes aware of the unbelief
and rejection of religion on the part of these
learned men, he concludes that to reject religion
is reasonable. “How many of such men gone
astray I have met, whose sole argument was that
just mentioned!” (p. 28).</p>

<p>Not only mathematics but astronomy and other
sciences were then in alleged conflict with the facts
of revelation. Al-Ghazali must have felt this very
keenly, for he says: “The ignorant Moslem thinks
the best way to defend religion is by rejecting all
the exact sciences. Accusing their professors of
being astray, he rejects their theories of the
eclipses of the sun and moon, and condemns them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
in the name of religion. These accusations are
carried far and wide, they reach the ears of the
philosopher who knows that these theories rest on
infallible proofs; far from losing confidence in
them, he believes, on the contrary, that Islam has
ignorance and the denial of scientific proofs for
its basis, and his devotion to philosophy increases
with his hatred to religion. It is therefore a great
injury to religion to suppose that the defense of
Islam involves the condemnation of the exact
sciences. The religious law contains nothing which
approves them or condemns them, and in their turn
they make no attack on religion. The words of
the Prophet: ‘The sun and moon are two signs of
the power of God; they are not eclipsed for the
birth or the death of any one; when you see these
signs take refuge in prayer, and invoke the name of
God’—these words I say, do not in any way condemn
the astronomical calculations which define
the orbits of these two bodies, their conjunction
and opposition according to particular laws.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
We must remember in this connection that it was
Omar Khayyam, the poet astronomer, who at this
very time was leading many into scepticism.</p>

<p>After a knowledge of Arabic grammar, and
memorizing the Koran, the diligent student would
take up its critical and devotional study. Al-Ghazali’s
teachers undoubtedly emphasized, as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
did himself, the importance of correct reading of
the sacred volume. In one of the most beautiful
passages in his <i>Ihya</i>, Al-Ghazali himself notes the
following points: The reader must be clean outwardly,
and respect the book with outward reverence.
He must read the proper quantity. He
quotes with approval the practice of Saʾad and
Othman, that the Koran should be read through
once a week. One should use chanting (<i>tartil</i>),
for this is helpful to the memory, and makes us
read slowly, and rapid reading is not approved.
One should read it with weeping, <i>i. e.</i>, sorrow for
sins. One should give the proper responses in the
proper places. One should use the opening prayer
before beginning to read. It may be read secretly
or aloud. It must be read beautifully—according
to the Tradition: “Adorn the Koran by the sweetness
of your voice;” or another Tradition: “He
who does not sing the Koran is not of our religion.”
One day when the Prophet heard Abu Musa reading
the Koran he said: “Verily, to this reader God
has given the voice of David when he wrote the
Psalms.”</p>

<p>We may believe that Yusuf Nassaj, his first
teacher, who was a mystic, as well as, later, the
Imam al-Haramain, laid considerable emphasis on
the points here mentioned. The atmosphere in
which Al-Ghazali was educated, we must never
forget, was that of mysticism.</p>

<p>The study of the Koran was followed by that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
of the Traditions, of which the standard collections
were already in circulation. After this, a
youth in Al-Ghazali’s day would begin the study
of <i>Fiqh</i>, or Moslem jurisprudence. We know
from the contents of the standard works on this
subject, written before Al-Ghazali’s time, and later
by himself, what engrossed the attention in the
schools of Tus and Jurjan.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> His first lesson would
be on ceremonial purity by the use of ablution, the
bath, the tooth-pick and the various circumstances
of legal defilement when <i>ghasl</i> or complete ablution
is prescribed; of the ailments of women and the
duration of pregnancy. Then came the second part
of the book on prayer, its occasions, conditions,
and requirements, including the four things in
which the prayer of a woman differs from that of
a man. He would learn all about the poor-rate
(<i>zakat</i>), about fasting and pilgrimage, about the
laws of barter and sale and debt; about inheritance
and wills—a most difficult and complicated subject.
Then the pupil would pass on to marriage
and divorce, a very large subject, and one on which
Moslem law books show no reserve, and leave no
detail unmentioned. Then would follow the laws
in regard to crime and violence, Holy War, and the
ritual of sacrifice at the Great Feast. The last
three chapters of books on <i>Fiqh</i> generally deal with
oaths, evidence, and the manumission of slaves.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>From his youth up Al-Ghazali belonged to the
Shafiʾ School, one of the four orthodox systems of
jurisprudence. The Imam ash-Shafiiʾ, whose tomb
at Cairo was afterwards visited by Al-Ghazali, and
is still a place of pilgrimage, died in <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 204. He
chose the <i>via media</i> between the slavery of tradition
and the freedom of logic and deduction in
Moslem law. According to Macdonald, “Ash-Shafiʾi
was without question one of the greatest
figures in the history of law. Perhaps he had not
the originality and keenness of Abu Hanifa; but
he had a balance of mind and temper, a clear vision
and full grasp of means and ends, that enabled him
to say what proved to be the last word in the
matter. After him came attempts to tear down;
but they failed. The fabric of the Muslim canon
law stood firm.” The adherents of the school of
Shafiiʾ now number some sixty million persons, of
whom about a half are in the Netherland Indies,
and the rest in Egypt, Syria, Hadramaut, Southern
India, and Malaysia. Among all of these Al-Ghazali
the Shafiʾite naturally holds a place of supreme
honour.</p>

<p>An interesting story is told in connection with
his studies under the Imam Abu Nasr al-Ismaʾili.
He took copious notes under this celebrated
teacher, but neglected to memorize what he had
written. This seems to have been a characteristic
of his, according to Macdonald, because his quotations
are often exceedingly careless; and one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
the charges brought against him by his assailants
afterwards was that he falsified tradition. “On his
way back to Tus from Jurjan, however, he got his
lesson. He tells the story himself. Robbers fell
upon him, stripped him, and even carried off the
bag with his manuscripts. This was more than he
could stand; he ran after them, clung to them
though threatened with death, and entreated the
return of the notes—they were of no use to them.
Al-Ghazali had a certain quality of dry humour,
and was evidently tickled by the idea of these
thieves studying law. The robber chief asked him
what were these notes of his. Said Al-Ghazali
with great simplicity: ‘They are writings in that
bag; I travelled for the sake of hearing them and
writing them down, and knowing the science in
them.’ Thereat the robber chief laughed consumedly,
and said: ‘How can you profess to know
the science in them, when we have taken them from
you and stripped you of the knowledge, and there
you are without any science?’ But he gave them
him back. ‘And,’ says Al-Ghazali, ‘this man
was sent by God to teach me.’ So Al-Ghazali
went back to Tus, and spent three years there committing
his notes to memory as a precaution against
future robbers.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Al-Ghazali left Tus a second
time to pursue his studies at Nishapur under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
most celebrated teacher of that period in this great
literary centre. Nishapur was situated forty-nine
miles west of Tus, and was captured by the Arabs
in <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 31. Yakut, in his geographical dictionary,
says that of all the cities he had visited this was the
finest. It was in this city that Hamadhani wrote
his four-hundred <i>Maqamat</i> and vanquished his
great literary rival.</p>

<p>Other great names are connected with the city,
among them Omar Khayyam the poet, the Koran
commentator Ahmed al-Thaʾlabi, and Maidani the
author of the well-known collection of Arabic
proverbs.</p>

<p>The older name of the town or district was
Abrashahr. The importance of the place under
the Sasanians was in part religious; one of the
three holiest fire temples was in its neighbourhood.
Nishapur under the Moslems contained a large Arab
element; it became the capital of Khorasan, and
greatly increased in prosperity, under the almost
independent princes of the house of Tahir (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
820-873). Istakhri describes it as a well-fortified
town, a league square, with a great export of cotton
goods and raw silk. In the decline of the empire
the city had much to suffer from the Turkomans,
whose raids have in modern times destroyed the
prosperity of this whole region. In 1153 it was
utterly ruined by the Ghuzz Turkomans, but soon
rose again, because, as Yakut remarks, its position
gave it command of the entire caravan trade with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
the East. It was taken and razed to the ground by
Mongols in 1221, but a century later Ibn Batuta
found the city again flourishing, with four colleges,
numerous students, and an export of silk-stuffs
to India. Nishapur was famous for its fruits
and gardens which gave it the epithet of “little
Damascus.”</p>

<p>We have an interesting portrait of Al-Ghazali’s
chief teacher while he was at Nishapur,—Abul-Maʾali
ʿAbdal-Malik Al-Juwaini Imam al-Haramain.
He was born at Bushtaniqan, near Nishapur,
on the twelfth of February, 1028, and was one of
the most learned and celebrated teachers of Moslem
law in his day. “On the death of his father,
Abu Muhammed ʿAbdallah ibn Yusuf, who was a
teacher in the latter town, he took his place, though
barely twenty years of age.” But this was a time
of literary prodigies due to precocious talent and
prodigious power of memory. “To complete his
own studies, and to make the sacred pilgrimage, he
went to Bagdad and thence to the two holy cities,
Mecca and Medina, where he taught for four
years; hence his surname, which signifies ‘the
teacher of the two holy places.’ When he returned
to Nishapur, Nizam Al-Mulk founded a school for
him, in which he gave courses of lessons till his
death, which overtook him on the twentieth of
August, 1085, while on a visit to his native village,
whither he had gone in the hope of recovering
from an illness. Along with his professorial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
duties, he had discharged those of a preacher. At
Nishapur he held gatherings every Friday, at which
he preached sermons, and presided over discussions
on various doctrinal points: to these occupations
he added that of managing the <i>waqfs</i>, or
landed property devoted to the support of pious
undertakings. For more than thirty years he continued
in undisputed possession of these various
posts. When he died, the mourning was general;
the great pulpit of the Mosque from which he had
delivered his sermons was broken up, and his
pupils, to the number of four hundred and one, destroyed
their pens and ink-horns, and gave up their
studies for a year.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It is certain that Al-Ghazali
sat at his feet as a learner, both at Nishapur and
Bagdad, and we may imagine that he had a part
also in the general mourning at the death of the
Imam, the manuscript of whose masterpiece,
<i>Nihayat al-Matlab</i> (Finality of Inquiry), is still
preserved in Cairo in the Sultania Library.</p>

<p>At Nishapur, Al-Ghazali was one of the favourite
pupils of this Imam, and here his studies were of
the broadest, embracing theology, dialectics,
philosophy and logic. He was a teacher as well
as a student, for we are told that he would “read to
his fellow students and teach them, until in a short
time he became infirm and weak.” Under the
double task his health failed, but he did not give
up his studies. The Imam once said of him, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
two other notable pupils: “Al-Ghazali is a sea to
drown in, Al-Kiya is a tearing lion, and Al-Khawafi
is a burning fire.” Another saying of
his about the same three was: “Whenever they
contend together, the proof belongs to Al-Khawafi,
the warlike attacks to Al-Ghazali, and clearness to
Al-Kiya.” To this time of his life belongs the
remark also, made by some one unnamed, “The
youth Al-Ghazali showed externally a vain-glorious
disposition, but underneath there was something
that when it did appear showed graceful expression
and delicate allusion, soundness of attention,
and strength of character.”</p>

<p>“I cannot ascertain,” says Macdonald in speaking
of this period of Al-Ghazali’s life, “whether
while he was still at Nishapur he touched those
depths of scepticism of which he speaks in the
<i>Munqidh</i>. They must certainly have been
reached some time before the year <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 484, and
must have been the outcome of a long drift of development;
but probably so long as he was under
the influence of the Imam-al-Haramain, a devout
Sufi, he would be held more or less fast to the old
faith.”</p>

<p>Of these struggles of his soul in an age of doubt
and how he found relief the next chapter will
tell us.</p>

<p>“Al-Ghazali is one of the deepest thinkers, greatest
theologians and profoundest moralists of Islam. In
all Muhamadan lands he is celebrated both as an
apologist of orthodoxy and a warm advocate of Sufi
mysticism. Intimately acquainted with all the learning
of his time, he was not only one of the numerous
Oriental philosophers who traverse every sphere of
intellectual activity, but one of those rarer minds
whose originality is not crushed by their learning.
He was imbued with a sacred enthusiasm for the
triumph of his faith, and his whole life was dedicated
to one purpose, the defense of Islam.”</p>

<h3>III<br>
TEACHING, CONVERSION, AND RETIREMENT</h3>

<p>With the death of the Imam in <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 478
a great change came into the life of
Al-Ghazali. He left Nishapur to seek
his fortune and it brought him to the camp court
of the great Vizier Nizam Al-Mulk. Here Al-Ghazali
sought advancement and the honours of
learning.</p>

<p>The camp court was the travelling capital of the
Seljuk Sultans. This imperial camp was laid out
into squares and streets. We read how in a few
hours a city, as if built by enchantment, would rise
on the uninhabited plain. The camp exhibited a
motley collection of tents and dwellings and palm-leaf
huts. The only regular part of the encampment
were the streets of shops, each of which was
constructed in the manner of a booth at an English
fair. Moore gives us the picture in these words:</p>

<p>As for Nizam Al-Mulk we have an interesting
autobiography which he wrote and left as a memorial
for future statesmen. (It is quoted in Mirkhond’s
“History of the Assassins.”) “One of
the greatest of the wise men of Khorasan,” says
he, “was the Imam Mowaffak of Nishapur, a man
highly honoured and reverenced,—may God rejoice
his soul; his illustrious years exceeded eighty-five,
and it was the universal belief that every boy
who read the Koran or studied the traditions in
his presence would assuredly attain to honour and
happiness. For this cause did my father send me
from Tus to Nishapur with Abd-us-Samad, the
doctor of law, that I might employ myself in study
and learning under the guidance of that illustrious
teacher. Towards me he ever turned an eye of
favour and kindness, and as his pupil I felt for him
extreme affection and devotion, so that I passed
four years in his service. When I first came there,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
I found two other pupils of mine own age newly
arrived—Hakim Omar Khayyam, and the ill-fated
Ibn Sabbah, founder of the sect of the Assassins.
Both were endowed with sharpness of wit and the
highest natural powers; and we three formed a
close friendship together. When the Imam rose
from his lectures, they used to join me, and we
repeated to each other the lessons we had heard.
Now Omar was a native of Nishapur, while Hasan
Ibn Sabbah’s father was one Ali, a man of austere
life and practice but heretical in his creed and doctrine.
One day Hasan said to me and to Khayyam:
‘It is a universal belief that the pupils of the
Imam Mowaffak will attain to fortune. Now, even
if we all do not attain thereto, without doubt one of
us will; what then shall be our mutual pledge and
bond?’ We answered: ‘Be it what you please.’
‘Well,’ he said, ‘let us make a vow, that to
whomsoever this fortune falls, he shall share it
equally with the rest, and reserve no preëminence
for himself.’ ‘Be it so,’ we both replied, and on
these terms we mutually pledged our words. Years
rolled on, and I went from Khorasan to Transoxiana,
and wandered to Ghazni and Kabul; and
when I returned I was invested with office, and rose
to be administrator of affairs during the Sultanate
of Sultan Alp Arslan.”</p>

<p>After his education at Nishapur Nizam Al-Mulk
served Alp Arslan, the successor of Togrul Bey,
and for more than twenty years the burden of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
empire of the Seljuks rested on his shoulders.
When Alp Arslan died in 465 Malek Shah succeeded
him and from that time until his assassination,
on the tenth of Ramadan, 485, Nizam Al-Mulk
was the greatest man in the empire and its
real ruler. He was a friend of learning and
letters and established colleges in many centres.</p>

<p>In <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 484, Al-Ghazali gained high fame at
court and was appointed by Nizam Al-Mulk to
teach in the <i>Madrasa</i> at Bagdad, the capital of the
whole of Eastern Islam.</p>

<p>We have an interesting picture of the city of
Bagdad about this time from the pen of Rabbi
Benjamin, of Tudela, who visited the city some
years after Al-Ghazali’s death (1160). He says:
“The circumference of the city of Bagdad measures
three miles; the country in which it is situated
is rich in palm-trees, gardens and orchards, so that
nothing equals it in Mesopotamia; merchants of
all countries resort thither for purposes of trade,
and it contains many wise philosophers well skilled
in sciences, and magicians proficient in all sorts
of witchcraft. The palace of the Caliph at Bagdad
is three miles in extent. It contains a large
park of all sorts of trees, both useful and ornamental,
and all sorts of beasts, as well as a pond of
water led thither from the river Tigris; and whenever
the Caliph desires to enjoy himself and to
sport and to carouse, birds, beasts and fishes are
prepared for him and for his councillors, whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
he invites to his palace.” He gives us a glimpse of
what went on behind the walls of these royal
palaces when he says: “All the brothers and other
members of the Caliph’s family are accustomed to
kiss his garments, and every one of them possesses
a palace within that of the Caliph; but they are all
fettered by chains of iron, and a special officer is
appointed over every household to prevent their
rising in rebellion against the great king. These
measures are enacted in consequence of an occurrence
which took place some time ago, and upon
which occasion the brothers rebelled and elected a
king among themselves. To prevent this in future,
it was decreed that all the members of the Caliph’s
family should be chained, in order to prevent their
rebellious intentions. Every one of them, however,
resides in his palace, is there much honoured,
and they possess villages and towns, the rents of
which are collected for them by their stewards;
they eat and drink, and lead a merry life.</p>

<p>“The palace of the great king contains large
buildings, pillars of gold and silver, and treasures
of precious stones. The Caliph leaves his palace
but once every year, viz., at the time of the feast
called Ramadan. Upon this occasion many visitors
assemble from distant parts, in order to have
an opportunity of beholding his countenance. He
then bestrides the royal mule, dressed in kingly
robes, which are composed of gold and silver cloth.
On his head he wears a turban, ornamented with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
precious stones of inestimable value; but over this
turban is thrown a black veil, as a sign of humility,
and as much as to say: ‘See, all this worldly
honour will be converted into darkness on the day
of death.’ He is accompanied by a numerous
retinue of Mohammedan nobles, arrayed in rich
dresses, and riding upon horses; princes of Arabia,
of Media, of Persia, and even of Thibet, a country
distant three months’ journey from Arabia. This
procession goes from the Palace to the Mosque at
the Basra gate, which is the Metropolitan Mosque.
All those who walk in procession are dressed in
silk and purple, both men and women. The streets
and squares are enlivened by singing, rejoicings,
and by parties who dance before the great king,
called Caliph. He is loudly saluted by the assembled
crowd, who cry, ‘Blessed art thou, our
lord and king.’ He thereupon kisses his garment,
and by holding it in his hand, acknowledges and
returns the compliment. The procession moves on
into the court of the Mosque, where the Caliph
mounts a wooden pulpit, and expounds their law
unto them. The learned Mohammedans rise, pray
for him, and praise his great kindness and piety;
upon which the whole assembly answer, ‘Amen.’
He then pronounces his blessing and kills a camel,
which is led thither for that purpose, and this is
their offering, which is distributed to the nobles.
These send portions of it to their friends, who are
eager to taste of the meat killed by the hands of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
their holy king, and are much rejoiced therewith.
He then leaves the Mosque, and returns alone to
his Palace along the banks of the Tigris, the noble
Mohammedans accompanying him in boats until he
enters his buildings. He never returns by the way
he came, and the path on the bank of the river is
carefully guarded all the year around, so as to prevent
any one treading in his footsteps. The Caliph
never leaves his palace again for a whole year.</p>

<p>“He is a pious and benevolent man, and has
erected buildings on the other side of the river, on
the banks of an arm of the Euphrates which runs
on one side of the city. These buildings include
many large houses, streets, and hostelries for the
sick poor, who resort thither in order to be cured.
There are about sixty medical warehouses here,
all well provided from the king’s stores with spices
and other necessaries; and every patient who claims
assistance is fed at the king’s expense until his cure
is completed. There is further the large building
called Dar-ul-Marastan (the abode of the insane),
in which are locked up all those insane persons who
are met with, particularly during the hot season,
every one of whom is secured by iron chains until
his reason returns, when he is allowed to return
to his home.”</p>

<p>We may add what the poet, Al-Hamadhani, a
contemporary, tells us of the luxuries of the table
at Bagdad: “We found ourselves among a company
who were passing their time amid bunches of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
myrtle twigs, and bouquets of roses, broached wine
vats and the sound of the flute and the lute. We
approached them and they advanced to receive us.
Then we clave to a table whose vessels were filled,
whose gardens were in flower, and whose dishes
were arranged in rows with viands of various hues;
opposite a dish of something intensely black was
something exceedingly white, and against something
very red was arranged something very yellow.”
And in another place: “I was in Bagdad in
a famine year, and so I approached a company,
united like the Pleiades, in order to ask something
of them. Now there was among them a youth
with a lisp in his tongue and a space between his
front teeth. He asked: ‘What is thy affair?’
I replied: ‘Two conditions in which a man prospers
not: that of a beggar harassed by hunger, and
that of an exile to whom return is impossible.’
The boy then said: ‘Which of the two breaches
dost thou wish stopped first?’ I answered:
‘Hunger, for it has become extreme with me.’
He said: ‘What sayest thou to a white cake on a
clean table, picked herbs with very sour vinegar,
fine date wine with pungent mustard, roast meat
ranged on a skewer with a little salt, placed now
before thee by one who will not put thee off with
a promise nor torture thee with delay, and who will
afterwards follow it up with golden goblets of the
juice of grape? Is that preferable to thee, or a
large company, full cups, variety of dessert, spread<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
carpets, brilliant lights, and a skilful minstrel with
the eye and neck of a gazelle?’”</p>

<p>From all this we can imagine what Al-Ghazali
enjoyed when he went to dine with the Nizam Al-Mulk
or other men of wealth and there was <i>no</i>
famine in Bagdad!</p>

<p>The Nizamiyya College which Al-Ghazali attended
and in which he was one of the leading
lecturers at two periods of his life, was built on
the eastern river bank of the Tigris, near the
Bridge of Boats and close to the wharf and the
large market-place. The college was founded in
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1065, being especially established for the
teaching of Shafiʾite law. Close to the college was
another college called the Bahaiyah and the hospital
Maristan Tutushi.</p>

<p>The traveller, Ibn Jubayr, attended prayers in
the Nizamiyya on the first Friday after his arrival
in Bagdad, in the year 581 (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1185), and he
describes it as the most splendid of the thirty and
odd colleges which then adorned the City of East
Bagdad.... Ibn Jubayr further reports that
in his day the endowments derived from domains
and rents belonging to the college amply sufficed
both to pay the stipends of professors and to keep
the building in good order, besides supplying an
extra fund for the sustenance of poor scholars.
The <i>Suk</i>, or market of the Nizamiyya, was one of
the great thoroughfares of this quarter, and it is
described as lying adjacent to the “<i>Mashraʾah</i>” or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
wharf, which proves that the college must have
stood near the Tigris bank.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> ... Writing a
dozen years later than Ibn Batuta, Hamd-Allah,
the Persian historian, briefly alludes to the
Nizamiyya, which he calls “the mother of the
Madrasahs” in Bagdad. This proves that down to
the middle of the fourteenth century <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> the college
was still standing, though at the present time
all vestiges of it have disappeared, as indeed appears
already to have been the case in the middle of the
last century, for Niebuhr found no traces of the
Nizamiyya to describe in his painstaking account
of the ruins in the city of Caliphs, as these still existed
in the time of his visit.</p>

<p>It was here, at the Nizamiyya School, that Al-Ghazali
first embarked on his career as an independent
teacher. His lectures drew crowds. He
gave <i>fatwas</i>, or legal opinions, on matters of the
law,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> he wrote books, he preached in the mosque,
and was a leader of the people. Then suddenly in
the midst of all this prosperity a great change came
over him. He seemed to be attacked by a mysterious
disease. His speech became hampered, his
appetite failed, and his physicians said the malady
was due to mental unrest. He suddenly left Bagdad
in the month of Dhu-l-Qada, 488, appointed
his brother Ahmed to teach in his place, and abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
all his property, except so much as was necessary
for his own support and that of his children.</p>

<p>This sudden retirement from active life and academic
honour was unintelligible to the theologians
of his days. They looked upon it as a calamity for
Islam. Some interpreted it as fear of the Government,
a flight from responsibility, but the real reason
of his renunciation he himself tells us in his
“Confessions.” This book reveals the story of
his spiritual experiences from his youth up to his
fiftieth year.</p>

<p>He says: “Know then, my brother (may God
direct you in the right way), that the diversity in
beliefs and religions, and the variety of doctrines
and sects which divide men, are like a deep ocean
strewn with shipwrecks, from which very few escape
safe and sound. Each sect, it is true, believes
itself in possession of the truth and of salvation;
‘each party,’ as the Koran saith, ‘rejoices in its
own creed’; but as the chief of apostles, whose
word is always truthful, has told us, ‘My people
will be divided into more than seventy sects of
whom only one will be saved.’ This prediction,
like all others of the Prophet, must be fulfilled.</p>

<p>“From the period of adolescence, that is to say,
previous to reaching my twentieth year to the
present time when I have passed my fiftieth, I have
ventured into this vast ocean; I have interrogated
the beliefs of each sect and scrutinized the mysteries
of each doctrine, in order to disentangle truth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
from error and orthodoxy from heresy. I have
never met one who maintained the hidden meaning
of the Koran without investigating the nature of
his belief, nor a partisan of its exterior sense without
inquiring into the results of his doctrine.
There is no philosopher whose system I have not
fathomed, nor theologian the intricacies of whose
doctrine I have not followed out.</p>

<p>“Sufism has no secrets into which I have not
penetrated; the devout adorer of Deity has revealed
to me the aim of his austerities; the atheist has not
been able to conceal from me the real reason of his
unbelief. The thirst for knowledge was innate in
me from my early age; it was like a second nature
implanted by God, without any will on my part.
No sooner had I emerged from boyhood than I had
already broken the fetters of tradition and freed
myself from hereditary beliefs.</p>

<p>“Having noticed how easily the children of
Christians become Christians, and the children of
Moslems embrace Islam, and remembering also the
traditional saying ascribed to the Prophet: ‘Every
child has in him the germ of Islam, then his parents
make him Jew, Christian, or Zoroastrian,’ I
was moved by a keen desire to learn what was this
innate disposition in the child, the nature of the
accidental beliefs imposed on him by the authority
of his parents and his masters, and finally the unreasoned
convictions which he derives from their
instructions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>Again he is full of doubts when he says: “Perhaps
also Death is that state [he is speaking of a
possible state of being which will bear the same
relation to our present state as this does to the condition
when asleep], according to a saying of the
Prince of Prophets: ‘Men are asleep; when they
die, they wake.’ Our present life in relation to the
future is perhaps only a dream, and man, once
dead, will see things in direct opposition to those
now before his eyes.</p>

<p>“Such thoughts as these threatened to shake my
reason, and I sought to find an escape from them.
But how? In order to disentangle the knot of this
difficulty, a proof was necessary. Now a proof
must be based on primary assumptions, and it was
precisely these of which I was in doubt. This unhappy
state lasted about two months, during which
I was not, it is true, explicitly or by profession, <i>but
morally and essentially a thoroughgoing sceptic</i>.”</p>

<p>That Al-Ghazali was driven to scepticism must
not surprise us. Schools of free thinkers had been
established fifty years earlier at Bagdad and Busrah.
Every Friday they gathered together. Some
were rationalists, some downright materialists.
Not only philosophers but poets were the leaders of
these circles. Among them we must mention
Abu’l ʾAla Al-Maʾarri, born in 973 <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> This blind
poet is said to have written a Koran in imitation
of Mohammed, and when some one complained to
him that although the book was well written it did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
not make the same impression as the true Koran,
he replied: “Let it be read from the pulpit of the
mosques for four hundred years and then you will
all be delighted with it.” His quatrains rival those
of Omar Al-Khayyam in their utter pessimism and
rank infidelity from the orthodox Moslem standpoint.
For example, he writes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Lo: there are many ways and many traps</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And many guides and which of them is Lord?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For verily Mohammed has the sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he may have the truth—perhaps? <i>perhaps?</i></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now <i>this</i> religion happens to prevail</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Until by <i>that</i> one it is overthrown,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Because men dare not live with men alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But always with another fairy-tale.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Religion is a charming girl, I say;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But over this poor threshold will not pass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Because I can’t unveil her, and alas;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bridal gift I can’t afford to pay.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nor could this poet have had much reverence for
the religion of Islam when he wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Where is the valiance of the folk who sing</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">These valiant stories of the world to come?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Which they describe, forsooth, as if it swung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In air and anchored with a yard of string.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="center">...</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Two merchantmen decided they would battle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To prove at last who sold the finest wares;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And while Mohammed shrieked his call to prayers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The true Messiah waved his wooden rattle.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As in the nineteenth century for Christianity, so
in the eleventh century for Islam, the struggle between
science and orthodoxy waged fiercely. The
rationalistic school of the Muʾtazilites still exercised
great influence while the literalists and the
blind followers of traditional Islam were often
more distinguished for Pharisaism than piety.</p>

<p>We need only turn to the “Maqamat” of Al-Hamadhani
to know what the sceptic of that day
thought of the public religious services.</p>

<p>“So I slipped away from my companions,” says
his hero, “taking advantage of the opportunity of
joining in public prayers, and dreading, at the same
time, the loss of the caravan I was leaving. But I
sought aid against the difficulty of the desert
through the blessing of prayer, and, therefore, I
went to the front row and stood up. The Imam
went up to the niche and recited the opening chapter
of the Quran according to the intonation of
<i>Hamza</i>, in regard to using ‘<i>Madda</i>’ and ‘<i>Hamza</i>,’
while I experienced disquieting grief at the thought
of missing the caravan, and of separation from the
mount. Then he followed up the Surat Al-Fatiha
with Surat Al-Waqʾia while I suffered the fire of
impatience and tasked myself severely. I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
roasting and grilling on the live coal of rage. But,
from what I knew of the savage fanaticism of the
people of that place, if prayers were cut short of
the final salutation, there was no alternative but
silence and endurance, or speech and the grave!
So I remained standing thus on the foot of necessity
till the end of the chapter. I had now despaired
of the caravan and given up all hope of the
supplies and the mount. He next bent his back for
the two prostrations with such humility and emotion,
the like of which I had never seen before.
Then he raised his hands and his head and said:
‘May God accept the praise of him who praises
Him,’ and remained standing till I doubted not but
that he had fallen asleep. Then he placed his right
hand on the ground, put his forehead on the earth
and pressed his face thereto. I raised my head to
look for an opportunity to slip away, but I perceived
no opening in the rows, so I re-addressed
myself to prayer until he repeated the <i>Takbir</i> for
the sitting posture. Then he stood up for the second
prostration, recited the Suras of Al-Fatiha and
Al-Qaria with an intonation which occupied the
duration of the Last Day and well-nigh exhausted
the spirits of the congregation. Now, when he
had finished his two prostrations and proceeded to
wag his jaws to pronounce the testimony to God’s
unity, and to turn his face to the right and to the
left for the final salutation, I said: ‘Now God has
made escape easy, and deliverance is nigh’; but a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
man stood up and said: ‘Whosoever of you loves
the companions of the Moslem community let him
lend me his ears for a moment.’”—Such was the
impression made by the formalities of orthodoxy!</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali found no help for his doubts among
these scholastic theologians nor has any Moslem
since his day. Professor Macdonald tells us why.
“Grant the theologians their premises, and they
could argue; deny them, and there was no common
ground on which to meet. Their science had been
founded by Al-Ashʾari to meet the Muʾtazilites; it
had done that victoriously, but could do no more.
They could hold the faith against heretics, expose
their inconsistencies and weaknesses; but against
the sceptic they could do nothing. It is true that
they had attempted to go further back and meet the
students of philosophy on their own ground, to
deal with substances and attributes and first principles
generally; but their efforts had been fruitless.
They lacked the necessary knowledge of the subject,
had no scientific basis, and were constrained
eventually to fall back on authority.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>“Nor did he find light in philosophy, although he
thoroughly studied the various systems of his day
and refuted them. Religion is not merely of the
mind but of the heart; philosophy had its place
but could satisfy only the intellect and left the
deepest longings of the soul unsatisfied. Next he
examined the teachings of the Taʾlimites, the contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
sect of the Ishmaelites founded by Hassan
Ibn as Sabbah. Theirs was the doctrine of
an Imam or infallible spiritual guide and the sect
found large following. But Al-Ghazali, so far
from being attracted by them, wrote several books
against them.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> No other path remained open for
the perplexed and sceptical seeker after God than
the way of the mystics. It was a return to the
early teaching he received at Tus and Nishapur and
to the atmosphere of his native land which was for
centuries steeped in mysticism. Of this period of
his life he was wont to say:</p>

<p>“When I wished to plunge into following the
people and to drink of their drink, I looked at my
soul and I saw how much it was curtained in, so
I retired into solitude and busied myself with religious
exercises for forty days, and there was
doled to me of knowledge I had not had purer and
finer than what I had known. Then I looked upon
it, and lo, in it was a legal element. So I returned
to solitude and busied myself with religious exercises
for forty days, and there was doled to me
other knowledge, purer and finer than what had
befallen me at first, and I rejoiced in it. Then I
looked upon it, and lo, in it was a speculative element.
So I returned to solitude a third time for
forty days, and there was doled to me other knowledge
that is known (<i>i. e.</i>, not simply perceived,
felt), and I did not attain to the people of the inward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
sciences. So I know that writing on a surface
from which something has been erased is not
like writing on a surface in its first purity and
cleanness, and I never separated myself from speculation
except in a few things.”</p>

<p>Who can read this and doubt his utter sincerity
in the search for God and for Truth?</p>

<p>He tells the rest of the story in his “Confessions”:
“I saw that Sufism consists in experiences
rather than in definitions, and that what I
was lacking belonged to the domain, not of instruction
but of ecstasy and initiation.</p>

<p>“The researches to which I had devoted myself,
the path which I had traversed in studying religious
and speculative branches of knowledge, had given
me a firm faith in three things—God, inspiration,
and the Last Judgment. These three fundamental
articles of belief were confirmed in me, not merely
by definite arguments, but by a chain of causes, circumstances,
and proofs which it is impossible to recount.
I saw that one can only hope for salvation
by devotion and the conquest of one’s passions, a
procedure which presupposes renouncement and
detachment from this world of falsehood in order
to turn towards eternity and meditation on God.
Finally, I saw that the only condition of success
was to sacrifice honours and riches and to sever the
ties and attachments of worldly life.</p>

<p>“Coming seriously to consider my state, I found
myself bound down on all sides by these trammels.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
Examining my actions, the most fair-seeming of
which were my lecturing and professorial occupations,
I found to my surprise that I was engrossed
in several studies of little value, and profitless as
regards my salvation. I probed the motives of my
teaching and found that, in place of being sincerely
consecrated to God, it was only actuated by a vain
desire of honour and reputation. I perceived that
I was on the edge of an abyss, and that without an
immediate conversion I should be doomed to eternal
fire. In these reflections I spent a long time.
Still a prey to uncertainty, one day I decided to
leave Bagdad and to give up everything; the next
day I gave up my resolution. I advanced one step
and immediately relapsed. In the morning I was
sincerely resolved only to occupy myself with the
future life; in the evening a crowd of carnal
thoughts assailed and dispersed my resolutions.
On the one side the world kept me bound to my
post in the chains of covetousness, on the other side
the voice of religion cried to me: ‘Up, Up, thy
life is nearing its end, and thou hast a long journey
to make. All thy pretended knowledge is nought
but falsehood and fantasy. If thou dost not think
now of thy salvation, when wilt thou think of it?
If thou dost not break thy chains to-day, when
wilt thou break them?’ Then my resolve was
strengthened, I wished to give up all and flee; but
the Tempter returning to the attack said: ‘You
are suffering from a transitory feeling; don’t give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
way to it, for it will soon pass. If you obey it, if
you give up this fine position, this honourable post
exempt from trouble and rivalry, this seat of authority
safe from attack you will regret it later on
without being able to recover it.’</p>

<p>“Thus I remained, torn asunder by the opposite
forces of earthly passions and religious aspirations,
for about six months from the month Rajab
of the year <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1096. At the close of them my
will yielded and I gave myself up to destiny. God
caused an impediment to chain my tongue and prevented
me from lecturing. Vainly I desired, in the
interest of my pupils, to go on with my teaching,
but my mouth became dumb.</p>

<p>“The enfeeblement of my physical powers was
such that the doctors despairing of saving me, said:
‘The mischief is in the heart, and has communicated
itself to the whole organism; there is no hope
unless the cause of his grievous sadness be arrested.’</p>

<p>“Finally, conscious of my weakness and the
prostration of my soul, I took refuge in God as a
man at the end of himself and without resources.
‘He who hears the wretched when they cry’
(Koran, xxviii. 63) deigned to hear me; He
made easy to me the sacrifice of honours, wealth,
and family” (“The Confessions,” pp. 42-45).</p>

<p>That his <i>conversion</i> did not mean ethically all
that the word means in the Christian sense is evident
from what immediately follows. He dissembled:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
“I gave out publicly that I intended to
make the pilgrimage to Mecca, while I secretly resolved
to go to Syria, not wishing that the Caliph
(may God magnify him) or my friends should
know my intention of settling in that country. I
made all kinds of clever excuses for leaving Bagdad
with the fixed intention of not returning
thither. The Imams of Irak criticized me with
one accord. Not one of them would admit that
this sacrifice had a religious motive, because they
considered my position as the highest attainable
in the religious community. ‘Behold how far
their knowledge goes’ (Koran, liii. 31). All kinds
of explanations of my conduct were forthcoming.
Those who were outside the limits of Irak attributed
it to the fear with which the Government
inspired me. Those who were on the spot and
saw how the authorities wished to detain me, their
displeasure at my resolution and my refusal of
their request, said to themselves, ‘It is a calamity
which one can only impute to a fate which has befallen
the Faithful and Learning.’</p>

<p>“At last I left Bagdad, giving up all my fortune.
Only, as lands and property in Irak can afford an
endowment for pious purposes, I obtained a legal
authorization to preserve as much as was necessary
for my support and that of my children; for there
is surely nothing more lawful in the world than that
a learned man should provide sufficient to support
his family. I then betook myself to Syria, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
I remained for two years, which I devoted to retirement,
meditation, and devout exercises. I only
thought of self-improvement and discipline and of
purification of the heart by prayer in going through
the forms of devotion which the Sufis had taught
me. I used to live a solitary life in the Mosque of
Damascus, and was in the habit of spending my
days on the minaret after closing the door behind
me” (pp. 45-46).</p>

<p>When Al-Ghazali determined to abandon the
world and set out as a pilgrim he was only following
the custom of his time. Not only religious
men but adventurers found in travel relief and
recreation. The pious did it, as they asserted, in
imitation of Jesus, the Messiah, whose name is
often interpreted as meaning “one who travels
constantly.” And the worldly-minded often donned
the garb of religious fakirs to satisfy their desire for
adventure and their ambition to see distant lands.</p>

<p>Because of facilities for travel by post and caravan
routes, this period seemed one of <i>wanderlust</i>
second to none. A scholar was not satisfied unless
he had seen the world of Islam. Of At-Tabrizi
(<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1030-1100), one of the contemporaries of
Al-Ghazali, who was also professor at the Nizamiyya
School, we read that when he desired to go
on a journey for literary purposes “he had no
money wherewith to hire a horse, so he put his
book into a sack and started to walk the long
journey from Persia to Syria. The sweat on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
back oozed through the material of his sack and
stained the precious manuscript, which was long
preserved and shown to visitors in one of the
libraries of Bagdad.” The Persian poet Saʾadi
was left an orphan at an early age, went to Bagdad
to attend the Nizamiyya University course, made
the Mecca pilgrimage several times over, acted, out
of charity, as a water-carrier in the markets of
Jerusalem and the Syrian towns, was taken prisoner
by the Franks, and forced to work with Jews
at cleaning out the moats of Tripoli in Syria; he
was ransomed by an Aleppan, who gave him his
daughter in marriage. He himself mentions his
visits to Kashgar in Turkestan, to Abyssinia, and
Asia Minor. He even travelled about India, passing
through Afghanistan on his way.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Interior of the Great Mosque at Damascus. In the center
the <i>Mihrab</i> showing the direction of prayer and to the right the
Great Pulpit.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We have a picture of such a dervish (a dishonest
one, however) in Hamadhani’s forty-second
<i>Maqamat</i>: “So I started wandering, as though I
was the Messiah, and I journeyed over Khorasan,
its deserted and populous parts, to Kirman, Sijistan,
Jilan, Tabaristan, Oman, to Sind and Hind,
to Nubia and Egypt, Yemen, Hijaz, Mecca and al
Taʾif. I roamed over deserts and wastes, seeking
warmth and the fire and taking shelter with the
ass, till both my cheeks were blackened. And thus
I collected of anecdotes and fables, witticisms and
traditions, poems of the humorists, the diversions
of the frivolous, the fabrications of the lovesick,
the saws of the pseudo-philosophers, the tricks of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
the conjurors, the artifices of the artful, the rare
sayings of convivial companions, the fraud of the
astrologers, the finesse of quacks, the deception of
the effeminate, the guile of the cheats, the devilry
of the fiends, such that the legal decisions of al-Shaʿabi,
the memory of al-Dabbi and the learning
of al-Kalbi would have fallen short of. And I
solicited gifts and asked for presents. I had recourse
to influence and I begged. I eulogized and
satirized, till I acquired much property, got possession
of Indian swords and Yemen blades, fine coats
of mail of Sabur and leathern shields of Thibet,
spears of al-Khatt and javelins of Barbary, excellent
fleet horses with short coats, Armenian mules,
and Mirris asses, silk brocades of Rum and woolen
stuffs of Sus.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>To the <i>honest</i> traveller, like Al-Ghazali, however,
it was not so easy a life. Not only were there the
hardships of travel and its loneliness, but the
asceticism of the beggar and the wayfarer. “And
to such a pass did we come,” says Hariri, “through
assailing fortune and prostrating need,—that we
were shod with soreness, and fed on choking, and
filled our bellies with ache, and wrapped our entrails
upon hunger, and anointed our eyes with
watching, and made pits our home, and deemed
thorns a smooth bed, and came to forget our saddles,
and thought destroying death to be sweet and
the ordained day to be tardy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>We may believe that so keen an observer as Al-Ghazali
carried his “<i>Baedeker</i>” with him on his
travels. He was doubtless acquainted with the
chief geographical works of that period, some of
which contained maps and even illustrations. The
most important work was that by Abu ʾAbdallah
al-Maqdisi, who spent a great part of his life
travelling all over the Moslem empire, with the
possible exception of India and Spain. His book
was entitled: “The Best Classification for the
Knowledge of Climates.” It was written in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
985. Another work of a contemporary of Al-Ghazali,
Abu ʾUbaid al-Bakri of Cordova, was a
general geography of all the roads and provinces
of the Moslem world.</p>

<p>Although we have no details of Al-Ghazali’s
wanderings we can at least follow him on his
journeys and learn something of the places he
visited and their condition in his day. The course
of his travels seems to have been from Bagdad to
Damascus, a journey of nearly five hundred miles,
from Damascus to Jerusalem and Hebron, thence
on to the birthplace of the Prophet at Mecca and
his tomb at Medina and back over a thousand miles
more of caravan travel.</p>

<p>All through this period of Al-Ghazali’s life
Damascus was experiencing the storm and stress
of war. Shortly before his time the city was taken
by the Karmatians and much of it was destroyed
by fire. There were frequent changes of governors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
uprisings and riots. In 1068 the great
Mosque was set on fire. In 1076 the Seljuk generals
seized the city, built anew the citadel and
other buildings, among them a famous hospital.
This was about fifteen years before Al-Ghazali’s
arrival there from Bagdad.</p>

<p>The great Ummayad Mosque of Damascus was
said to be the grandest of all Mohammedan buildings.
There was praying space for 20,000 men;
and it is said to have taken the whole revenue of
Syria for forty-seven years, not counting eighteen
shiploads of gold and silver from Cyprus to complete
the building. “When the wondrous work
was finished, the Caliph would not look at the accounts
brought to him on eighteen laden mules, but
ordered that they should be burned and thus addressed
the crowd: ‘Men of Damascus, you possess
four glories above other people; you are proud of
your water, your air, your fruits, your baths; your
mosque shall be your fifth glory.’”</p>

<p>Like other famous places of Moslem worship,
this mosque was once the site of a Christian church,
dedicated to St. John the Baptist, to whom there is
still an imposing shrine. For some years the
building was shared between Christians and
Mohammedans, but in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 708 the Christians
were driven out. To this day one of the three
minarets is called by the name of <i>ʾIsa</i> (Jesus), and
above a gate, long since closed, is the Greek inscription,
“<span class="smcap">Thy kingdom, O Christ, is an everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
kingdom, and Thy dominion endureth
throughout all generations.</span>”</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali spent many hours for many years
under the shadow of this great building, and it was
in the minaret of Jesus that he had long meditations.
The minaret of Jesus, according to H. Saladin,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
was built in the eleventh century, shortly before
the time of Al-Ghazali’s visit. Did he ever
find or understand the inscription on the gate and
meditate on that Prophet whose kingdom has no
end and no frontier?</p>

<p>“Then came the immediate breaking up of the
Seljukian Empire into a number of independent
principalities. Syria, Palestine, and all Asia Minor,
were partitioned among a dozen different Turkish
Emirs. Khorasan and Irak became the scene of a
fierce civil war, extending over several years, between
two sons of Malek Shah, Barkiaroc and
Muhammed. Drought was added to the horrors of
war; the people perished by thousands of famine;
the incessant marching and counter-marching of the
hostile armies destroyed the remnant of food which
had survived the want of rain. To crown all, from
the borders of Christendom a fresh scourge was beheld
preparing for Islam. The hosts of the Red
Cross passed the Bosphorus, and fought their way
knee-deep in blood to the walls of Jerusalem. The
capture of the Holy City struck like the point of a
poisoned dagger to the heart of every true Moslem.”</p>

<h3>IV<br>
WANDERINGS, LATER YEARS, AND DEATH</h3>

<p>The chronology of Al-Ghazali’s life was a
puzzle even to those who wrote only a
century after his death. There seems
great uncertainty not only as to the time of his
various journeyings but as to their order, and there
is dispute even regarding the places he visited.
We know that the date of his conversion was
<span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 488 (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1095), when he was thirty-eight
years old, and that shortly after this he went into
exile. In <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 498 (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1104) he is said to have
returned to active life, and to have spent two years
in retirement in Syria. The other dates are quite
uncertain. Following the best authorities at our
disposal, especially his own “Confessions,” we
continue the story where we left off in the last
chapter.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>“From Damascus,” says Al-Ghazali, “I proceeded
to Jerusalem, and every day secluded myself
in the Sanctuary of the Rock. After that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
felt a desire to accomplish the Pilgrimage, and to
receive a full effusion of grace by visiting Mecca,
Medina, and the Tomb of the Prophet. After
visiting the shrine of the Friend of God (Abraham),
I went to the Hejaz. Finally, the longings
of my heart and the prayers of my children brought
me back to my country, although I was so firmly
resolved at first never to revisit it. At any rate,
I meant, if I did return, to live there solitary and
in religious meditation; but events, family care,
and vicissitudes of life changed my resolutions and
troubled my meditative calm. However irregular
the intervals which I could give to devotional
ecstasy, my confidence in it did not diminish; and
the more I was diverted by hindrances, the more
steadfastly I returned to it. Ten years passed in
this manner.”</p>

<p>According to this account his pilgrimage to
Jerusalem and Hebron, to Medina and Mecca, was
part of one itinerary; it also is the natural route of
travel from Bagdad to the birthplace of Islam.
The statement made by some authorities that he
first remained ten years at Damascus is therefore
probably inaccurate. If we are to believe al-Isnawi,
the course of events was as follows: He
set out in the year <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1095 for the Hejaz. On
his return from the pilgrimage, he journeyed to
Damascus, and made his abode there for some
years in the minaret of the Grand Mosque, composing
several works of which the <i>Ihya</i> is said to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
be one. Then after visiting Jerusalem and perhaps
Cairo and Alexandria, he returned to his home
at Tus.</p>

<p>According to one Arabic authority, when Al-Ghazali
left Damascus in his wanderings, he was
accompanied by a disciple, a certain Abu Tahir
Ibrahim, who had been a pupil also at Nishapur
under the great Imam; he returned afterwards to
Jurjan, his native place, and died a martyr in
<span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 513. Other pupils of his at Damascus are
also mentioned, but the authorities do not agree.</p>

<p>Among many shrines at Jerusalem, Al-Ghazali
visited the Mosque of Omar, and the Dome of the
Rock. In Sura xvii. 1, Mohammed is represented
as having taken his flight from Mecca to Jerusalem.—“Celebrated
be the praises of Him who by
night took his servant from the <i>Masjidu ’l-Haram</i>
(the Sacred Mosque) to the <i>Masjidu ’l-Aqsa</i> (the
Remote Mosque), the precinct of which we have
blessed.”</p>

<p>As-Suyuti says Jerusalem is specially honoured
by Moslems as being the scene of the repentance
of David and Solomon. “The place where God
sent His angel to Solomon, announced glad tidings
to Zacharias and John, showed David a plan of the
Temple, and put all the beasts of the earth and
fowls of the air in subjection to him. It was at
Jerusalem that the prophets sacrificed; that Jesus
was born and spoke in His cradle; and it was from
Jerusalem that Jesus ascended to heaven; and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
will be there that He will again descend. Gog
and Magog shall subdue every place on the earth
but Jerusalem, and it will be there that God Almighty
will destroy them. It is in the holy land
of Jerusalem that Adam and Abraham, and Isaac
and Mary are buried. And in the last days there
will be a general flight to Jerusalem, when the Ark
and the Shechinah will be again restored to the
Temple. There will all mankind be gathered at
the Resurrection for judgment, and God will enter,
surrounded by His angels, into the Holy Temple,
when He comes to judge the earth.”</p>

<p>Here Al-Ghazali would see the sacred footprint
of Mohammed made in the rock on his journey to
heaven; the praying places of Abraham and Elijah
would be pointed out to him; the round hole where
the rock let Mohammed through when he ascended
to heaven; the holy place in the roof of the cavern
where it arose to allow him to stand erect and to
pray; the tongue with which it spoke; and the
marks of the Angel Gabriel’s finger where it had
to be held down from following him in his ascension!
The place is also pointed out by Moslems
to-day where Solomon tormented the demons, and
also near the eastern wall where the throne stood
whereon he sat when dead, the corpse leaning on
his staff to cheat the demons until the worms had
gnawed it through and the body fell forward. All
this is found in Moslem Tradition, and must have
stirred the credulity or the scepticism of Al-Ghazali.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
He himself tells us in one of his books
that on the last day Israfil, who, with Gabriel and
Michael, has been restored to life, “standing on the
rock of the temple of Jerusalem, will at the command
of God call together the souls from all parts,
those of believers from Paradise and the unbelievers
from hell, and throw them into his trumpet.
There they will be ranged in little holes, like bees
in a hive, and will, on his giving the last sound, be
thrust out and fly like bees, filling the whole space
between earth and heaven. Then they will repair
to their respective bodies. The earth will then be
an immense plain without hills or villages, and the
dead, after they have risen, will sit down each one
on his tomb, anxiously waiting for what is to
come.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>A modern traveller describes other Moslem
superstitions connected with this Mosque. “The
little arcades at the top of the steps of the platform
are called ‘Balances,’ because the scales of
judgment are to be suspended there on the Great
Day. The Dome of the Chain owes its name to
the circumstance that there a golden chain hung at
David’s place of judgment, which had to be
grasped by witnesses and dropped a link when a
lie was told. A place in the outer wall is shown
from which a wire will be suspended on the Day of
Judgment, whose other end will be made fast to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Mount of Olives. Christ will sit on the wall and
Mohammed on the mount. Over this wire must
all men find their way, but only the good will cross,
the wicked falling into the valley beneath. In the
Al-Aqsa Mosque a couple of pillars stand very
near each other, so worn that they are perceptibly
thinned. The space between them bulges, and a
piece of spiked iron work is now inserted between
them. These are another test for the final award—he
who could squeeze himself between them, and
he alone, had found the true ‘narrow way to
heaven.’”</p>

<p>We have descriptions of Jerusalem by a Moslem
who wrote at the end of the tenth, and by another
of the middle of the eleventh century. The latter
estimated the population at twenty thousand, and
fancied that as many more Moslem pilgrims came
to the city in the month of their pilgrimage; Christians
and Jews then visited the city as they do
to-day. Both these writers praise the place for its
cleanliness, which they attribute to its geographical
position and natural drainage. Yet the history of
Jerusalem throughout this century is little more
than the record of damage and repair to Christian
and Moslem sanctuaries. In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1010 the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre was destroyed by the mad
Sultan Hakim. This was followed by other
humiliations of the pilgrims and persecutions, until
Peter the Hermit arose in protest and the Crusades
began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>We have no information as to how Al-Ghazali
spent his days during this visit at Jerusalem. It
was a time of war and tumult throughout Syria, on
the eve of the Crusades. One can imagine with
what interest Al-Ghazali studied the whole situation
and how this ardent champion of the Moslem
faith was stirred by the coming events whose
shadows were already resting on the Holy Land at
the time of his visit there. We do know that he
lived the life of a mystic, and devoted himself to
prayer and fasting. Prayer occupies a large place
in the life of every conscientious Moslem. Not
only are there the five ritual prayers, but the night
prayer which, according to Al-Ghazali himself,
must be performed between midnight and the beginning
of dawn. It has been calculated that a
Moslem conscientiously performing his devotions
recites the same form of prayer at least seventy-five
times a day. In addition to these prayers, however,
there are prayers called <i>witr</i> to be performed
after the night prayer; <i>dhuha</i>, the prayer used in
the forenoon; and the prayer of night vigils, which
take place between the last evening prayer and midnight.
In addition to observing all the above mentioned
prayers, those who would reach a high degree
of perfection are recommended by Al-Ghazali,
in accordance with his own practices at this period,
to engage in certain additional devotional exercises
called <i>wird</i>. We may best note the character
of this mystical devotion, in which he spent whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
days and nights, by quoting in substance from the
<i>Ihya</i> as follows:</p>

<p>“From many verses of the Koran it appears that
the only way of becoming united with God is constant
intercourse with Him. This is the object of
the devotional services called <i>wird</i> in which the believer
can engage at all times of the day as well as
the night. The <i>wirds</i> to be observed during the
day are seven: First <i>wird</i>. The Moslem on rising
early mentions the name of God, and praises Him,
reciting certain petitions; while dressing, he recites
the appointed petitions, cleans his teeth with
the <i>miswak</i>, performs the <i>Wudhu</i>, then prays two
Sunna <i>rakaʾs</i> of dawn.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> After this he repeats a
petition and goes to the mosque with collected
thoughts. He enters the mosque solemnly and respectfully
with the right foot first, saying the appointed
petitions on entering and leaving. He
enters the first rank of worshippers if there be
room, and prays the two <i>rakaʾs</i> of dawn, if he has
not done so already at home; then two <i>rakaʾs</i> of
‘Saluting the Mosque,’ and sits down repeating
petitions and praises, awaiting the assembling of
the congregation. After having repeated the
obligatory prayer of dawn, he remains sitting in
the mosque till sunrise, meditating and repeating
certain petitions, and praises a certain number of
times, counting them by the rosary, and reciting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
portions of the Koran. [We know that the rosary
was in general use from a reference to it in the
“Assemblies” of al-Hariri, and in Al-Ghazali’s
“Alchemy of Happiness.”] The second <i>wird</i> is between
sunrise and an advanced forenoon hour; the
worshipper says a prayer of two <i>rakaʾs</i>, and when
the sun has risen the length of a lance above the
horizon two more <i>rakaʾs</i>. This is the time when
the believer may perform good works, such as
visiting the sick, etc. When nothing of the kind
requires his attention, he spends his time in repeating
petitions, in <i>zikr</i>, meditation and reading the
Koran. The third <i>wird</i> is between morning and
the ascending of the sun; the believer, after taking
care of his worldly affairs, engages in the devotional
exercises as before mentioned. Between
the time when the sun has become somewhat high
and the noon prayer, four <i>rakaʾs</i> between the <i>Azan</i>
and the <i>Ikama</i> are said and portions of the Koran
are recited; this is the fourth <i>wird</i>. The fifth,
sixth and seventh occur after this until vespers.
Finally there are the <i>wirds</i> of the night which are
five, divided and described as follows:—First night
<i>wird</i>: after sunset, when the prayer of sunset has
been performed, to the time when darkness has set
in, the worshipper says two <i>rakaʾs</i>, in which certain
portions of the Koran are recited, then four long
<i>rakaʾs</i>, and as much of the Koran as time allows.
This <i>wird</i> may be performed at home; but it is
preferable to do so in the mosque. Second night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
<i>wird</i>: this is from the darkness of the last <i>ʿIsha</i>
to the time when people retire to sleep. This consists
of three things: (1) the obligatory <i>ʿIsha</i>
prayer; ten <i>rakaʾs</i>, viz., four before it and six after
it; (2) performing a prayer of thirteen <i>rakaʾs</i>, the
last of which is the <i>witr</i> prayer. In this about
three hundred verses of the Koran are to be recited.
(3) The <i>witr</i> prayer before going to sleep,
unless one is accustomed to rise in the night, when
it may be performed later on, which is more meritorious.
Third night <i>wird</i>: this consists of sleep,
and sleep may well be considered a devotional act,
if enjoyed in the proper way. Fourth night <i>wird</i>:
this is from the time when the first half of the
night is spent to when only one-sixth of it still
remains. At this time the believer ought to rise
from sleep and perform the prayer of <i>tahajjud</i>.
This prayer is also called the <i>hujud</i>. Mohammed
mostly made it a prayer of thirteen <i>rakaʾs</i>. Fifth
night <i>wird</i>: this begins with the last sixth of the
night, called the <i>Sahar</i>, the early morning before
dawn to the appearing of dawn.” To these devotional
exercises, described in the <i>Ihya</i>, it was considered
meritorious to add four additional good
actions: fasting, almsgiving, visiting the sick, attending
funerals; and finally all this punctilious remembrance
of God through prayer was supplemented
by what is called <i>dhikr</i>—the special method
of worship used by the Sufi saints.</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali describes the method and effects of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
this practice in a passage which Macdonald has
summarized as follows: “Let the worshipper reduce
his heart to a state in which the existence of
anything and its non-existence are the same to him.
Then let him sit alone in some corner, limiting his
religious duties to what is absolutely necessary, and
not occupying himself either with reciting the
Koran or considering its meaning or with books of
religious traditions or with anything of the sort.
And let him see to it that nothing save God most
High enters his mind. Then, as he sits in solitude,
let him not cease saying continuously with his
tongue, ‘Allah, Allah,’ keeping his thought on it.
At last he will reach a state when the motion of his
tongue will cease, and it will seem as though the
word flowed from it. Let him persevere in this
until all trace of motion is removed from his
tongue, and he finds his heart persevering in the
thought. Let him still persevere until the form of
the word, its letters and shape, is removed from his
heart, and there remains the idea alone, as though
clinging to his heart, inseparable from it. So far,
all is dependent on his will and choice; but to bring
the mercy of God does not stand in his will or
choice. He has now laid himself bare to the
breathings of that mercy, and nothing remains but
to wait what God will open to him, as God has done
after this manner to prophets and saints. If he
follows the above course, he may be sure that the
light of the Real will shine out in his heart. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
first unstable, like a flash of lightning, it turns and
returns; though sometimes it hangs back. And if
it returns, sometimes it abides and sometimes it is
momentary. And if it abides, sometimes its abiding
is long, and sometimes short.”</p>

<p>Such is the teaching of Al-Ghazali in regard to
the true life of devotion and such we may believe
was his own practice at Damascus and Jerusalem
during the years that followed his life of exile—the
endless repetition of God’s great names and
“prayer without ceasing” in the Moslem sense.
One wonders what part of the day remained for
the literary work and teaching in which we know
he was also engaged.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>An interesting story is told of his life at Jerusalem
in these words: “There came together the
Imams Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali and Ismail Al-Kakimi
and Ibrahim Ash-Shibaki and Abu-l-Hasan
Al-Basri, and a large number of foreign elders, in
the Cradle of ʾIsa (upon him be peace!) in Jerusalem,
and he (Al-Ghazali, apparently) recited
these two lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘May I be thy ransom! were it not for love thou wouldst have ransomed me, but by the magic of two eye-pupils thou hast taken me captive.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">I came to thee when my breast was straitened through love, and if thou hadst known how was my longing, thou wouldst have come to me.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Then Abu-l-Hasan Al-Basri constrained himself to
an ecstasy which affected those that were present,
and eyes wept and garments were rent and Mohammed
Al-Kazaruni died in the midst of the assembly
in ecstasy.”</p>

<p>In Jerusalem he is said to have written his <i>Risalat
Al-Qudsiya</i>; and the date of his visit there must
have been shortly before <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 492, for in that year
Jerusalem was captured by the Crusaders.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>It was natural for one of Al-Ghazali’s temperament
to desire to pay homage also at the tomb of
Abraham, whom Moslems delight to call the
“Friend of God.” The religion of Islam is continually
called the religion of Abraham in the
Koran. Tradition locates the so-called Machpelah
Cave in the eastern part of the present-day Hebron,
on the edge of the valley, and the mosque which
now stands there is supposed to enclose the grave.
Hebron is about seventeen miles southwest of
Jerusalem. Before the twelfth century the Cave
of Machpelah began to attract visitors and pilgrims.
“Benjamin of Tudela relates: ‘At Hebron
there is a large place of worship called “St. Abraham,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
which was previously a Jewish synagogue.
The natives erected there six sepulchres, which
they tell foreigners are those of the Patriarchs and
their wives, demanding money as a condition of
seeing them. If a Jew gives an additional fee to
the keeper of the cave, an iron door which dates
from the time of our forefathers opens, and the
visitor descends with a lighted candle. He crosses
two empty caves, and in the third sees six tombs,
on which the names of the three Patriarchs and
their wives are inscribed in Hebrew characters.
The cave is filled with barrels containing bones of
people, which are taken there as to a sacred place.
At the end of the field of the Machpelah stands
Abraham’s house with a spring in front of it.’”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The mosque of Hebron, over the tomb of Abraham,
consists at present of a quadrangular platform
about seventy yards long by thirty-five wide. The
tomb which it covers is one of the sites which few
Christian eyes have seen. It is permitted to none
but Moslems to approach nearer the entrance than
the seventh step of the staircase along the eastern
wall.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>Hebron is one of the oldest cities in the world
and legends of all sorts have gathered about the
place. Even in Al-Ghazali’s day it was spoken
of as the place of Adam’s creation and death, the
scene of Abel’s murder, and the place where Abraham
made his home.</p>

<p>After Al-Ghazali’s visit to Hebron he probably
made his pilgrimage to Mecca. Whether the journey
was made by sea or by land, we do not know.
In any case it was full of peril at that period. Very
possibly Al-Ghazali took the long caravan journey,
following the route of the Damascus pilgrimage
in our day. It was considered proper, however, to
visit Mecca first, and Medina on the return journey.
Al-Ghazali himself advises this in his directions
for the correct performance of the rites of
pilgrimage.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In what spirit he fulfilled the rites we know from
one of his spiritual teachers whose text-book on
the subject Al-Ghazali had mastered. “A man
who had just returned from the pilgrimage came
to Junayd. Junayd said: ‘From the hour when
you first journeyed from your home have you also
been journeying away from all sins?’ He said
‘No.’ ‘Then,’ said Junayd, ‘you have made
no journey. At every stage where you halted for
the night did you traverse a station on the way to
God?’ ‘No,’ he replied. ‘Then,’ said Junayd,
‘you have not trodden the road, stage by stage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
When you put on the pilgrim’s garb at the proper
place, did you discard the qualities of human nature
as you cast off your clothes?’ ‘No.’ ‘Then
you have not put on the pilgrim’s garb. When
you stood on ʾArafat, did you stand one moment
in contemplation of God?’ ‘No.’ ‘Then you
have not stood at ʾArafat. When you went to
Muzdalifa and achieved your desire, did you renounce
all sensual desires?’ ‘No.’ ‘Then you
have not gone to Muzdalifa. When you circumambulated
the Kaʾaba, did you behold the immaterial
beauty of God in the abode of purification?’
‘No.’ ‘Then you have not circumambulated
the Kaʾaba. When you ran between
Safa and Marwa, did you attain to purity (<i>safa</i>)
and virtue (<i>muruwwat</i>)?’ ‘No.’ ‘Then you
have not run. When you came to Mina, did all
your wishes (<i>muna</i>) cease?’ ‘No.’ ‘Then you
have not yet visited Mina. When you reached
the slaughter place and offered sacrifices, did you
sacrifice the objects of worldly desire?’ ‘No.’
‘Then you have not sacrificed. When you threw
the pebbles, did you throw away whatever sensual
thoughts were accompanying you?’ ‘No.’ ‘Then
you have not yet thrown the pebbles, and you have
not yet performed the pilgrimage.’”</p>

<p>Such was the mystical interpretation of the rites
at Mecca taught by the Sufis to their disciples.</p>

<p>Mecca, when Al-Ghazali made the pilgrimage,
was under the rule of the Sherif Abu Hashim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
(<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1063-1094). Half a century earlier the
Karmathians, perhaps the most fanatic of all Moslem
sects, had besieged Mecca, captured the city,
murdered the pilgrims by thousands, and carried
away the famous black stone to Bahrein on the
Persian Gulf.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> By taking away this sacred treasure
they hoped to put an end to the pilgrimage, but
were disappointed. In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 950 the stone was returned
for a heavy ransom.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> It was because of
the constant disputes between the Caliphs of Bagdad
and Egypt that the defense of the holy cities
was finally given into the hand of the Sherifs.</p>

<p>Abu Hashim was a time-server, and cared more
for bribes than for religion, according to the testimony
of Arabian chroniclers. In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1070 he
changed the name of the Fatimide Sultans for that
of the Abbassides at Friday prayers, and received
much bounty. In 1075 he sold the same privilege
to the Fatimides, and in 1076 to the Caliphs of
Bagdad. This conduct so enraged the Sultan of
Bagdad that in 1091 he sent bands of Turkomans
against Mecca.</p>

<p>Chronicles of the holy city during this period
show that the pilgrimage was accompanied by
grave dangers because of Bedouin robbers as well
as disturbances in Mecca itself. Sometimes these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
uprisings were directed by Abu Hashim himself, as
was the case in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1094.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Just about the time of Al-Ghazali’s visit, the
various buildings at Mecca and the <i>Beit Allah</i> itself,
had been repaired and beautified. The four
<i>maqams</i> or places of prayer for the orthodox sects
as they now stand were built in <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 1074. The
place of the Shafiʿ sect to which Al-Ghazali belonged,
is directly over the well of Zem Zem, to
which it serves as an upper chamber. The building,
erected in 1072, is in use to-day. The great
pulpit of white marble was sent to Mecca in <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span>
969 by the Sultan of Egypt. It is still in use.
Perchance Al-Ghazali ascended these very stairs
and addressed the pilgrims. In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1030 a violent
torrent swept over Mecca, and nearly ruined the
Kaʾaba. The repairs were not finished until 1040.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>With his religious pilgrimage to Mecca and
Medina it seems that Al-Ghazali’s life of strict
retirement ended, except for his visit to Alexandria
and beyond. Apparently he proposed to make a
journey to Spain and the great Sultan of the West,
Yusuf bin Tashfin, on whose behalf he had given
<i>Fatwas</i> or religious decisions, but the news of the
Sultan’s death put an end to his plans, according
to some authorities. Others say that at this time
he was summoned to teach again at Nishapur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>The details of his life during the mysterious ten
years of his wanderings are most conflicting. According
to ʿAbd al-Ghafir, a personal friend of Al-Ghazali,
he went a second time to Mecca, afterwards
to Syria, and then wandered from shrine to
shrine for nearly ten years. Next to “The Confessions,”
the best authority on his life is undoubtedly
this same ʿAbd al-Ghafir. What he tells us of Al-Ghazali’s
life must have been gained from personal
knowledge, or go back immediately to Al-Ghazali
himself. “According to him, Al-Ghazali
set out on pilgrimage to Mecca, then went to Syria,
and remained there wandering from place to place
and shrine to shrine nearly ten years. At this time
he composed several of his works, the <i>Ihya</i> and
books abbreviated from it, such as the <i>Arbaʾin</i> and
the <i>Rasaʾil</i>; besides labouring at his own spiritual
advancement and growth through the religious exercises
of the Sufis. Then he returned to his home
and lived there a retired life for some time, absorbed
in meditation, but gradually becoming more
and more sought after as a teacher and guide to
the spiritual life. At length Fakhr al-Mulk ʾAli b.
Nizam Al-Mulk Jamal Ash-Shuhada, who had previously
been Wazir to Barqiyaruq, became Wazir
to Sinjar the son of Malik Shah at Nishapur, and
by him such pressure was put on Al-Ghazali that he
finally consented to resume teaching in the Maymuna
Nizamiyya Madrasa there.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>We have reference to but no detail of Al-Ghazali’s
visit to Cairo, the great centre of Moslem
architecture and learning in the West, as Bagdad
was in the East. Nor, strange to say, have I found
reference in his works to this visit. It is possible
that he was not received altogether with favour by
the religious leaders of Al-Azhar at the time, but
his reputation was already world-wide, and many
of his pupils at Bagdad and Nishapur were from
Egypt and North Africa.</p>

<p>At the time of Al-Ghazali’s visit, Cairo was still
the great centre of Arab civilization, and had all
the glory which the Fatimid dynasty had bestowed
upon it. The splendid palaces of the Caliphs
formed the central portion of the town. The
three massive gates which still command admiration
at the present day, Bab Al-Futuh, Bab Al-Nasr
and Bab Az-Zuwaila, led into the city. In
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1087 the walls were rebuilt, and these massive
gateways constructed along with others which are
no longer standing. In the vault of the archways
of these gates, there used to be two chambers, and
these were used by the Egyptian sovereigns and
their friends to watch the various spectacles, especially
the departure and return of the sacred carpet.</p>

<p>The intellectual and religious life of the city
centred in the great mosque of Al-Azhar, which
had been completed in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1012. Cairo was not
yet the economic centre for all Egypt which it became
later, but it was the seat of a splendid court,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
with military pageantry, as well as a centre of religious
learning. Ibn Tuwair and others have
given us vivid pictures of the ceremonial processions
and festivals, the magazines, treasuries,
stables, and royal household.</p>

<p>As for Alexandria, where we <i>know</i> Al-Ghazali
lived for some time before his return to Syria, it
did not have a high reputation at that time for
learning. It was rather a port of trade, from
which men passed on to Misr (Cairo) or went by
sea to Syria. Hamadhani makes one of his characters
say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I am of the citizens of Alexandria,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of sound and pure stock among them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The age and the people thereof are stupid,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore I made my stupidity my steed!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But in Moslem tradition, Alexandria has high
honour. Moslems show the tomb of Daniel the
prophet, also that of Alexander the Great whose
story is told in the Koran. Alexandria also boasts
two celebrated Walis or holy men. One is Mohammed
al Busiri, the author of the poem called
Al Burdah, universally celebrated; and the other
Abu Abbas Al-Andalusi, at whose tomb prayer is
never offered in vain. There is also a prophecy
that when Mecca falls into the hands of the infidels
Alexandria will succeed to its honours.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>From Alexandria Al-Ghazali went to Damascus
and then to Nishapur and from there to Bagdad, or
from Damascus direct to Bagdad, where he taught
the <i>Ihya</i> and preached. As-Subki tells us that the
people crowded to hear him, and that notes of his
sermons to the number of 183 were taken by one
of those present, who read them to Al-Ghazali before
they were circulated.</p>

<p>The following story is told of his life at this
time: Once while teaching the <i>Ihya</i> at Bagdad, he
began to quote: “He has made beloved the homes
of men, as abodes of desire which the heart has
decreed; whenever they remember their homes
these remind them of the pledges of youth there,
and they long thither.” Then he wept, and those
present wept with him. Thereafter some one saw
him in the open country with a patched dervish-garment
on, a water-vessel and an iron-shod staff
in his hand,—all in strange contrast to the states in
which he had seen him before, with three hundred
pupils around him, including one hundred of the
chief men of Bagdad. So he said, “O Imam, is
not the teaching of science more fitting?” But
Al-Ghazali looked at him with red eyes and said,
“When the full moon of happiness rises in the
firmament of will, the sun of setting departs in the
East of union.” Then he recited, “I abandoned
the love of Layla and my happiness was far, and I
returned to the companionship of my first alighting-place;
then cried to me my longings, ‘Welcome!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
these are the alighting-places of her whom
thou lovest, draw up and alight.’”</p>

<p>Of his spiritual experiences during these ten
years of retirement and wandering, and during the
years that followed, when he taught others the way
of the mystic, we will speak later.</p>

<p>We know that he left Bagdad, returned to Tus,
his native place, and settled down to study and contemplation.
Strange to say, at this time of his life
he seems to have found the greatest delight in going
back again to the study of Tradition, especially
the collections of Al-Bokhari and of Muslim. All
his biographers seem to agree in this. He had
charge of a <i>madrasa</i> and of the <i>khanka</i> or monastery
for Sufis. Every moment was filled with
study and devotion until in the fifty-fifth year of
his life (lunar calendar) the end came.</p>

<p>The austerity and privations of his long wanderings
doubtless wore down his strength. One
who had risen to so high a position of authority
on religious matters also had to pay the price of
leadership in controversy with opponents, and of
their envy, and their slander, as we are told by al-Ghafir.
This may have been, Macdonald thinks,
one of the causes for his removal from Nishapur to
Tus. A friend remarks in regard to his attitude
towards those who opposed his teaching and envied
his influence: “However much he met of contradiction
and attack and slander, it made no impression
on him, and he did not trouble himself to answer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
his assailants. I visited him many times, and
it was no bare conjecture of mine that he, in spite
of what I saw in him in time past of maliciousness
and roughness towards people, and how he looked
upon them contemptuously through his being led
astray by what God had granted him of ease in
word and thought and expression, and through the
seeking of rank and position, had come to be the
very opposite and was purified from these stains.
And I used to think that he was wrapping himself
in the garment of pretense, but I realized after investigation
that the thing was the opposite of what
I had thought, and that the man had recovered
after being mad.”</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali died on Monday, the fourteenth of
Jumada II, <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 505 (Dec. 18th, 1111). His brother
Ahmad (quoted by Murtadha from Ibn Jawzi’s
<i>Kitab ath-thabat ʾind al-mamat</i>) gives the following
account of his death: “On Monday, at dawn,
my brother performed the ablution and prayed.
Then he said, ‘Bring me my grave-clothes,’ and he
took them and kissed them and laid them on his
eyes and said, ‘I hear and obey to go in to the
King.’ And he stretched out his feet towards
Mecca, and was taken to the good will of God
Most High. He was buried at, or outside of,
Tabran, the citadel of Tus, and Ibn As-Samaʾni
visited his grave there.”</p>

<p>Later biographers were not satisfied with the
bare facts of his decease. Murtadha gives a far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
more interesting story. “When death drew near
to the Imam Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali, he commanded
his servant, an excellent and religious man,
to dig his grave in the middle of his house, and to
summon the people of the neighbouring villages to
attend his funeral; that they should not touch him,
but that a company of three men unknown in the
region of Al-ʾIraq would come out of the desert,
that two of them would wash him, and the third
would undertake the prayer over him without the
advice or command of any one. Then, when he
died, the servant did according to all that he had
commanded, and required the presence of the people.
And when the people gathered to attend the
funeral, they saw three men who had come out of
the desert. Two of them began to wash the corpse,
while the third vanished and did not appear. But
when they had washed him and arranged him in
the grave-clothes, and carried his bier and laid it
on the edge of the grave, the third appeared
wrapped in his robe with a black border on both
sides, turbaned with wool, and he prayed for him
and the people prayed with him. Then he gave the
benediction and departed and hid from the people.
And some of the excellent of the people of Al-ʾIraq
who were present at the funeral had noticed him
carefully, but did not know him until some of them
heard a <i>Hatif</i> in the night saying to them, ‘The
man who led the people in prayer is Abu ʾAbd
Allah Mohammed b. Ishaq Amghar, the Sharif.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
He came from the farthest Maghrib, from ʾAyn
al-Qatr, and those who washed the corpse are his
comrades Abu Shuʾayb Ayyub b. Saʾid and Abu
ʾIsa Wajih.’ And when they heard that they
journeyed from Al-ʾIraq to Sanhaja of the farthest
Maghrib, and when they had reached them and
asked of them their prayers, they returned to Al-ʾIraq
and related it to the Sufis and published their
miracle (<i>karama</i>). Then a company of them,
when they heard that, went to visit them and found
them to be those whom they noticed carefully, and
they asked of them their prayers. And this is a
strange story.”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>An equally remarkable story is told of the death
of Al-Ghazali’s younger brother in the books of the
Persian mystics.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The verses given might well apply
to Al-Ghazali himself and his views of life and
death. “Moghith related, on the authority of
Kadiri tradition, how the famous Ahmed-Al-Ghazali,
native of Tus in Persia, said one day to
his disciples, ‘Go and bring me new and white
garments.’ They went; and on returning with the
objects required, found their master dead; by his
side was a paper on which were written the following
stanzas:</p>

<p>We are indebted to the Rev. Dwight M. Donaldson
of Mashad, Persia, for the interesting photographs
of the ruins of Tus and of the supposed
tomb of Al-Ghazali. The mosque is very old and
probably dates from the time of Al-Ghazali. The
grave shown in the picture, however, <i>may</i> not be
the grave of Al-Ghazali the mystic but of another
celebrated Ghazali. For we read in As-Subqi (Vol.
III, p. 36) that there was one called Ahmed ibn
Mohammed Abu Hamed Al-Ghazali, the older and
earlier one. He says that people have thrown
doubt upon his very existence, but that after careful
inquiry he has found mention of this man in
several books, including the <i>Kitab Al Ansab</i> of Ibn
As-Samʾani. He mentions the fact that this man
also lived in Khorasan, was celebrated for his
learning, wrote books on theological questions, and
was buried at Tus, where his grave was well
known; and because of this people called him the
Old Ghazali, and used to come to his grave in order
to obtain answers to their prayers. He thinks
that this Ghazali was either the uncle or the grand-uncle
of Al-Ghazali, whose biography we have
written. Incidentally we may conclude from this
statement of As-Subqi that the name of Al-Ghazali<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
was not given to him because his <i>father</i> was a
spinner of wool! It must have been an old family
name.</p>

<p>Mr. Donaldson gives this interesting information:
“The walls of the old city of Tus still stand.
It is one <i>farsakh</i> around them, three and a third
miles. There are many fragments of towers and
in nine places there are remains of gates. The
wall was originally five yards wide. In the largest
cemetery the tombstone of Ahmad Ghazali may
still be seen. This cemetery lies southwest from
the city and while the bulk of it is now under cultivation,
the more distant part that lies on the higher
ground beyond the waterway has been kept a
cemetery.</p>

<p>“The picture I have enclosed of Ghazali’s tomb is
not as satisfactory as I would have liked. It shows
that a large chip has been taken from one corner
of the grave. The stone is about two yards long,
one-third yard wide, and one-third yard high.
There are positive indications of an effort having
been made to cut off the portion on which the name
of Ahmed Al-Ghazali appears. It is the part that
is chipped in the picture. About at the point where
the chipping appears to begin there is a straight line
cut about one inch deep across the top of the stone.</p>

<p>“On the road that runs through the city from the
southwest gate the old mosque is imposing even in
its ruined condition. It stands eighteen yards high
and the inner measurements show it to consist of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
a square base, five yards high, then an octagonal
structure eight yards high. (See illustration.)</p>

<p>“Outside the southwest gate an ancient bridge is
still in use, as caravans from Mashad come through
the old city of Tus. This bridge has eight arches,
each four and one-half yards wide. The name of
the stream is the <i>Kashf Rud</i>.</p>

<p>“The fortress itself is interesting; it is surrounded
by a moat and a wall, within which lies a
large courtyard and the high approach to the fort itself.
At present we could walk around the wall and
approach the fort by a passage in the rear. In the
courtyard they are now raising the best water-melons
we have eaten in Persia. Four gigantic
corner fragments of the fort are now standing. In
the midst of the débris of bricks within these old
walls we found interesting fragments of pottery.”</p>

<p>In another letter from Mashad, Persia, dated
January 17, 1917, the Rev. Dwight M. Donaldson
writes: “This week I made another trip to Tus,
carefully examining again the tombstone of
Ghazali. As I wrote you before, the stone has
been badly worn and in addition to that has been
mutilated. However, on the point of doubt as to
whether the stone photographed was really the one
marking Mohammed Al-Ghazali’s tomb, or the
tomb of another Ahmad Al-Ghazali, I can now say
that I believe it is the tomb of Abu Hamed ibn
Mohammed ibn Mohammed ibn Mohammed Al-Ghazali,
for the reason that we can clearly read<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
on the corner of the top of the stone, the end
which some one in times past attempted to cut off,
the name ‎‏غزّالي‏‎ and ‎‏بوحا‏‎. And as one studies the
stone he is almost willing to declare that the
name is fully intelligible with the exception of
the initial <i>aleph</i>. The whole top is badly worn indeed,
but the word that my <i>mirza</i> first read as
Ahmad is clearly not Ahmad, but what it is we
cannot tell. The damage is too complete.</p>

<p>“You will notice that Ghazzali appears in the
stone to have been spelled with a <i>tashdeed</i> and yet
the mark we have considered a tashdeed is not the
usual form (v instead of w).”</p>

<p>This investigation, therefore, would seem to
settle two points: that we have at Tus the neglected
and mutilated grave of the great mystic and theologian,
Al-Ghazali; and that on this grave the
middle letter of the name is double. In view of
the common usage, however, and in deference to
the authorities of Moslems themselves, we have
uniformly written Ghazali.</p>

<p>“This man, (Al-Ghazali) if ever any have deserved
the name, was truly a ‘divine,’ and he may be
justly placed on a level with Origen, so remarkable
was he for learning and ingenuity, and gifted with
such a rare faculty for the skilful and worthy exposition
of doctrine. All that is good, noble, and sublime
that his great soul had compassed he bestowed upon
Mohammedanism, and he adorned the doctrines of
the Koran with so much piety and learning that, in
the form given them by him, they seem, in my opinion,
worthy the assent of Christians. Whatsoever was
most excellent in the philosophy of Aristotle or in the
Sufic mysticism he discreetly adapted to the Mohammedan
theology; from every school he sought the
means of shedding light and honour upon religion;
while his sincere piety and lofty conscientiousness
imparted to all his writings a sacred majesty. He
was the first of Mohammedan divines.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<h3>V<br>
HIS CREED AND CREDULITY</h3>

<p>Although, according to his own testimony
in his “Confessions,” Al-Ghazali
was troubled from his earliest years with
doubt and scepticism, he was not willing to yield
to it, and his faith rose triumphant above all his
doubts. This is one of the outstanding facts in
his biography. He could say with the writer of
the Epistle to the Hebrews that “faith is the substance
of things hoped for and the evidence of
things not seen.” Not only did he find God in
nature and in his own conscience and consciousness,
but he was a firm believer in revelation.
Naturally the only revelation to which Al-Ghazali
turned as the basis, the very bed-rock of religious
faith, was the Koran, the eternal, uncreated word
of God according to Moslem teaching; and also
to the life of the Prophet Mohammed, his practices
and his precepts handed down in orthodox
Tradition—this also was a revelation from God.</p>

<p>Whether he ever read the Old and New Testament
is a question we consider unanswered. He
did not draw his creed from this source.</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali gives the distinction very clearly, almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
as clearly as the Epistle of James, between
faith and works. He was a dogmatic theologian
and laid down, as we shall see in this chapter, with
punctilious care every point of dogma; but he was
also a moralist and a man of high ideals which he
sought to attain through prayer and fasting and
pilgrimage, and a life of utter devotion to the will
of God. His faith was living and practical, not
theoretical and scholastic. In his great work, the
<i>Ihya</i>, he discusses the whole subject of faith, and
enumerates the following classes of believers:</p>

<p>“He who combines inner belief with outward
confession and good works is a true believer and
enters Paradise.</p>

<p>“He who combines inner belief with outward
confession and some good works but commits one
or more great sins, does not thereby cease to be a
believer, though his faith is not of the highest degree.
The Muʾtazila deny that such a one can be
considered a believer, but that nevertheless by committing
deadly sins he does not become an unbeliever
but is in an intermediate state between a
believer and an infidel. An infidel is an impious
person and goes into everlasting hell-fire.”</p>

<p>The opinions with regard to the person who combines
inner belief with outward confession, but has
no good works are divided. Abu Talibu’l Makki
says: “Good works are part of the faith, and faith
cannot exist without them.” The Sunni doctors
of Islam, however, reject this opinion as absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
false, for they say that it is a truth accepted by
general agreement, that a man who believes and
confesses and dies before he has done any good
work, is a true believer and enters Paradise; that
good works cannot consequently be considered as
a necessary part of faith, and that faith can exist
without them.</p>

<p>“He who believes in his heart, but dies before he
has either confessed or performed good works, is
nevertheless a true believer and enters into Paradise.
Those who consider confession a necessary
part of faith naturally consider that such a one has
died without faith, an opinion absolutely contrary
to the Sunni dogma.</p>

<p>“He who believes in his heart, and has time and
opportunity of confessing, and knows that it is the
duty of the Moslem to do so, and does not confess
his faith, is nevertheless a believer in the sight of
God, and will not be cast into everlasting hell-fire,
for faith is the mere belief, intellectual conviction
and assent, and this belief does not cease to exist
through the want of outward confession. Such a
man is a believer in the sight of God, but an unbeliever
in this world before the court of justice
and with regard to the rights of Moslems. In case
of an impediment of the tongue, a sign with the
hand is as good as confession with the tongue.
The sect of the Murjiʾa go too far by saying that a
believer, even if he act wickedly, will never enter
hell-fire. <i>The orthodox doctrine on this subject<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
is that every one, even the most perfect believer,
will enter hell-fire, for no one is free from committing
some sins, for which he must enter fire;
only infidels, however, will remain in it forever.</i>”</p>

<p>“He who confesses with the tongue saying:
‘There is no God but God, and Mohammed is His
apostle,’ but does not believe it in his heart is an
infidel in the sight of God, and will be cast into
eternal hell-fire. In this world, however, he is to
be considered and treated as a believer and a Moslem,
for man cannot penetrate into the secrets of
the heart, and the confession of the mouth must be
taken to be the interpreter of the thoughts of the
heart. In order, however, to make a man a Moslem
in this world, before the law, in the sight of
the Qadi, confession is necessary.”</p>

<p>Not only does he classify believers in this careful
way, but he also discusses the question, in the
first book of his <i>Ihya</i>, whether Islam is the same
thing as <i>iman</i> (faith) or not, and if these two are
not the same thing, can they exist separately or
must they necessarily be combined? “Some say
that Islam and <i>Iman</i> are synonymous terms and
that consequently every believer is a Moslem and
every Moslem a believer.” This is the opinion
held by the orthodox school. Others say that they
are distinct things but joined together. Al-Ghazali
answers this difficult question in this way: <i>Iman</i>
(Faith), from the linguistic point of view, means
belief, intellectual conviction and assent; Islam<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
means submission, subjection, obedience. The seat
of <i>Iman</i> is the heart or mind, and the tongue is its
interpreter. Islam comprises belief with the heart
and confession with the tongue, and good works
by the members of the body, and is consequently
a more comprehensive term than <i>Iman</i>. <i>Iman</i> is
one of the component parts of Islam, and Islam,
therefore, includes it; but <i>Iman</i>, being a more restricted
term, does not include Islam. From a
linguistic point of view the two terms are therefore
not synonymous. From the point of view of the
law and religion, and in a theological sense the two
terms are sometimes used as being synonymous,
and sometimes as having different meanings and as
being intermingled, comprised in each other. <i>Iman</i>
and Islam are found in the individual who believes
in his heart and outwardly observes the precepts of
Islam; Islam exists separately in the individual,
who only believes in his heart; but neither confesses,
nor does good works, and Islam exists separately
in him who outwardly observes the precepts
of Islam, without inner belief.</p>

<p>What the faith of Islam meant to Al-Ghazali we
know from all his works, especially from the <i>Ihya</i>,
which besides other topics gives a full exposition
of Moslem belief in regard to the six articles of
their creed and the five pillars of practice. The
reader may judge for himself both the contents and
omissions of Al-Ghazali’s <i>credo</i> from the following
brief exposition which he wrote for his pupils:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">HIS CREED<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>“We say—and in God is our trust—Praise belongeth
unto God, the Beginner, the Bringer-back,
the Doer of what He willeth, the Lord of the Glorious
Throne and of Mighty Grasp, the Guider of
His chosen creatures to the right path and to the
true way, the Granter of benefits to them after the
witness to the Unity (<i>tawhid</i>) by guarding their
articles of belief from obscurities of doubt and opposition.
He that bringeth them to follow His
Apostle, the Chosen one (<i>Al-Mustafa</i>) and to imitate
the traces of His Companions, the most honoured,
through His aid and right guidance revealed
to them in His essence and His works by His beautiful
qualities which none perceives, save he who
inclines his ear. He is the witness who maketh
known to them that He in His essence is One without
any partner (<i>sharik</i>). Single without any
similar, Eternal without any opposite, Separate
without any like. He is One, Prior (<i>qadim</i>) with
nothing before Him, from eternity (<i>azali</i>) without
any beginning, abiding in existence with none after
Him, to eternity (<i>abadi</i>) without any end, substituting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
without ending, abiding without termination.
He hath not ceased and He will not cease to be
described with glorious epithets; finishing and ending,
though the cutting off of the ages and the terminating
of allotted times have no rule over Him,
but He is the First and Last, the External and the
Internal, and He knoweth everything.</p>

<p>“We witness that He is not a body possessing
form, nor a substance possessing bounds and limits;
He does not resemble bodies, either in limitation
or in accepting division. He is not a substance
and substances do not exist in Him; and He is not
an accident and accidents do not exist in Him, nay
He does not resemble an entity, and no entity resembles
Him; nothing is like Him and He is not
like anything; measure does not bound Him and
boundaries do not contain Him; the directions do
not surround Him and neither the earth nor the
Heavens are on different sides of Him. Lo, He
is seated firmly upon His throne (<i>ʿarsh</i>), after the
manner which He has said, and in the sense in
which He willed a being-seated firmly (<i>istawa</i>),
which is far removed from contact and fixity of
location and being established and being enveloped
and being removed. The Throne does not carry
Him, but the Throne and those that carry it are
carried by the grace of His power and mastered by
His grasp. He is above the Throne and the
Heavens and above everything unto the limit of the
Pleiades, with an aboveness which does not bring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
Him nearer to the Throne and the Heavens, just as
it does not make Him further from the earth and
the Pleiades. Nay, He is exalted by degrees from
the Throne and the Heavens, just as He is exalted
by degrees from the earth and the Pleiades; and
He, in spite of that, is near to every entity and
is ‘nearer to a creature than the artery of his neck’
(Koran 50, 15), and He witnesseth everything,
since His nearness does not resemble the nearness
of bodies, just as His essence does not resemble the
essence of bodies. He does not exist in anything,
just as nothing exists in Him; He has exalted Himself
far therefrom that a place should contain Him,
just as He has sanctified Himself far therefrom
that time should limit Him. Nay, He was before
He had created Time and Place and He is now
above that which He was above, and distinct from
His creatures through His qualities. There is not
in His essence His equal, nor in His equal His essence.
He is far removed from change of state or
of place. Events have no place in Him, and mishaps
do not befall Him. Nay, He does not cease,
through His glorious epithets, to be far removed
from changing, and through His perfect qualities
to be independent of perfecting increase. The existence
of His essence is known by reason; His essence
is seen with the eyes, a benefit from Him and
a grace to the pious, in the Abiding Abode and a
completion in beatitude from Him, through gazing
upon His gracious face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“We witness that He is living, powerful, commanding,
conquering; inadequacy and weakness befall
Him not; slumber seizes Him not, nor sleep.
Passing away does not happen to Him, nor death.
He is Lord of the Worlds, the Visible and the Invisible,
that of Force and that of Might; He possesses
Rule and Conquest and Creation and Command;
the heavens are rolled in His right hand and
the created things are overcome in His grasp; He
is separate in creating and inventing; He is one in
bringing into existence and innovating; He created
the creation and their works and decreed their sustenance
and their terms of life; not a decreed thing
escapes His grasp and the mutations of things are
not distant from His power; the things which He
hath decreed cannot be reckoned and the things
which He knoweth have no end.</p>

<p>“We witness that He knoweth all the things that
can be known, comprehending that which happeneth
from the bounds of the earth unto the topmost
heavens; no grain in the earth or the heavens is distant
from His knowledge. Yea, He knows the
creeping of the black ant upon the rugged rock in
a dark night, and He perceives the movement of
the mote in the midst of the air; He knows the
secret and the concealed and has knowledge of the
suggestions of the minds and the movements of the
thoughts and the concealed things of the inmost
parts, by a knowledge which is prior from eternity;
He has not ceased to be describable by it, from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
ages of the ages, not by a knowledge which renews
itself and arises in His essence by arrival and removal.</p>

<p>“We witness that He is a Willer of the things
that are, a Director of the things that happen; there
does not come about in the world seen or unseen,
little or much, small or great, good or evil, advantage
or disadvantage, faith or unbelief, knowledge
or ignorance, success or loss, increase or diminution,
obedience or rebellion, except by His will.
What He wills is, and what He wills not is not.
Not a glance of one who looks, or a slip of one who
thinks is outside of His will; He is the creator, the
Bringer back, the Doer of that which He wills.
There is no opponent of His command and no repeater
of His destiny and no refuge for a creature
from disobeying Him, except by His help and His
mercy, and no strength to a creature to obey Him
except by His will. Even though mankind and the
<i>Jinn</i> and the Angels and the <i>Shaytans</i> were to unite
to remove a single grain in the world or to bring
it to rest without His will, they would be too weak
for that. His will subsists in His essence as one
of His qualities; He hath not ceased to be described
through it as a Willer, in His infinity of the existence
of things at their appointed times which He
hath decreed. So they come into existence at their
appointed times even as He has willed in His infinity
without precedence or sequence. They happen
according to the agreement of His knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
and His will, without exchange or change in planning
of things, nor with arranging of thoughts or
awaiting of time, and therefore one thing does not
distract Him from another.</p>

<p>“And we witness that He is a Hearer and a Seer.
He hears and sees and no audible thing is distant
from His hearing, and no visible thing is far from
His seeing, however fine it may be. Distance does
not curtain off His hearing and darkness does not
dull His seeing; He sees without eyeball or eyelid,
and hears without earholes or ears, just as He
knows without a brain and seizes without a limb
and creates without an instrument, since His qualities
do not resemble that quality of created things,
just as His essence does not resemble the essences
of created things.</p>

<p>“And we witness that He speaks, commanding,
forbidding, praising, threatening, with a speech
from all eternity, prior, subsisting in His essence,
not resembling the speech of created things. It is
not a sound which originates through the slipping
out of air, or striking of bodies; nor is it a letter
which is separated off by closing down a lip or
moving a tongue. And the Koran and the <i>Tawrat</i>
(the Law of Moses) and the <i>Injil</i> (the Gospel) and
the <i>Zabbur</i> (the Psalms) are His books revealed to
His Apostles. And the Koran is repeated by
tongues, written in copies, preserved in hearts; yet
it in spite of that, is prior subsisting in the essence
of God, not subject to division and separation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
through being transferred to hearts and leaves.
And Musa heard the speech of God without a
sound and without a letter, just as the pious see the
essence of God, in the other world without a substance
or an attribute.</p>

<p>“And since He has those qualities, He is living,
Knowing, Powerful, a Willer, a Hearer, a Seer, a
Speaker, through Life, Power, Knowledge, Will,
Hearing, Seeing, Speech, not by a thing separated
from His essence.</p>

<p>“We witness that there is no entity besides Him,
except what is originated from His action and proceeds
from His justice, after the most beautiful
and perfect and complete and just of ways. He is
wise in His actions, just in His determinations;
there is no analogy between His justice and the
justice of creatures, since tyranny is conceivable in
the case of a creature, when he deals with the property
of some other than himself, but tyranny is not
conceivable in the case of God. For He never encounters
any property of some other than Himself
so that His dealing with it might be tyranny.
Everything besides Him, consisting of men and
<i>Jinn</i> and Angels and <i>Shaytans</i> and the heavens and
the earth and animals and plants and inanimate
things and substance and attribute and things perceived
and things felt, is an originated thing, which
He created by His power before any other had created
it, after it had not existed, and which He invented
after that it had not been a thing, since He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
in eternity was an entity by Himself, and there was
not along with Him any other than He. So He
originated the creation thereafter, by way of manifestation
of His power, and verification of that
which had preceded of His Will, and of that which
existed in eternity of His Word; not because He
has any lack of it or need of it. And He is gracious
in creating and in making for the first time
and in imposing of duty—not of necessity—and
He is generous in befitting; and well-doing and
gracious helping belong to Him, since He is able to
bring upon His creatures different kinds of punishment
and to test them with different varieties of
pains and ailments. And if He did that it would
be justice on His part, and would not be a vile action
or tyranny in Him. He rewardeth His believing
creatures for their acts of obedience by a
decision which is of generosity and of promise and
not of right and of obligation, since no particular
action towards any one is incumbent upon Him, and
tyranny is inconceivable in Him, and no one possesses
a right against Him. And His right to acts
of obedience is binding upon the creatures because
He has made it binding through the tongues of His
prophets, not by reason alone. But He sent apostles
and manifested their truth by plain miracles,
and they brought His commands and forbiddings
and promisings and threatenings. So, belief in
them as to what they have brought is incumbent
upon the creation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>“The second Word of Witnessing is witnessing
that the apostolate belongs to the apostle, and that
God sent the unlettered Qurayshite prophet, Mohammed,
with his apostolate to the totality of
Arabs and foreigners and Jinn and men. And He
abrogated by his law the other Laws except so
much of them as He confirmed; and made him excellent
over the rest of the prophets and made him
the Lord of Mankind and declared incomplete the
Faith that consists in witnessing the Unity, which
is saying, ‘There is no god except God,’ so long as
there is not joined that of witnessing to the Apostle,
which is saying ‘Mohammed is the Apostle of
God.’ And He made obligatory upon the creation
belief in Him, as to all which He narrated concerning
the things of this world and the next. And
then He would not accept the faith of a creature,
so long as he did not believe in that which the
Prophet narrated concerning things after death.
The first of these is the question of Munkar and
Nakir; these are two awful and terrible beings who
will cause the creature to sit up in his grave, complete,
both soul and body; and they will ask him,
‘Who is thy Lord, and what is thy religion (<i>din</i>),
and who is thy Prophet?’ They are the two
testers in the grave and their questioning is the
first testing after death. And that he should believe
in the punishment of the grave—that it is a
Verity and that its judgment upon the body and
the soul is just, according to what God wills. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
that he should believe in the Balance—it with the
two scales and the tongue, the magnitude of which
is like unto the stages of the heavens and the earth.
In it, deeds are weighed by the power of God Most
High; and its weights in that day will be the weight
of motes and mustard seeds, to show the exactitude
of its justice. The leaves of the good deeds will
be placed in a beautiful form in the scale of light;
and then the Balance will be weighed down by them
according to the measure of their degree with God,
by the grace of God. And the leaves of evil deeds
will be cast in a vile form into the scale of darkness,
and the Balance will be light with them, through
the justice of God. And that he should believe
that the Bridge (<i>as-Sirat</i>) is a Verity; it is a bridge
stretched over the back of Hell (<i>Jahannam</i>),
sharper than a sword and finer than a hair. The
feet of the unbelievers slip upon it, by the decree of
God, and fall with them into the Fire. But the
feet of believers stand firm upon it, by the grace of
God, and so they pass into the Abiding Abode.
And that he should believe in the Tank (<i>Hawdh</i>),
to which the people shall go down, the Tank of
Mohammed from which the believers shall drink
before entering the Garden and after passing the
Bridge. Whoever drinks of it a single draught
will never thirst again thereafter. Its breadth is a
journey of a month; its water is whiter than milk
and sweeter than honey; around it are ewers in
numbers like the stars of heaven; into it flow two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
canals from <i>Al-Kawthar</i> (Koran 108). And that
he should believe in the Reckoning and in the distinctions
between men in it, him with whom it will
go hard in the Reckoning and him to whom compassion
will be shown therein, and him who enters
the Garden without reckoning,—these are the honoured
(<i>muqarrab</i>). God Most High will ask
whomsoever He will of the prophets, concerning
the carrying of His message, and whomsoever He
will of the unbelievers, concerning the rejection of
the messengers; and He will ask the innovators
(<i>Mubtadiʾs</i>) concerning the Sunna; and the Moslems
concerning works. And that he should believe
that the attestors of God’s Unity (<i>muwahhids</i>)
will be brought forth from the Fire, after
vengeance has been taken on them, so that there
will not remain in Hell an attestor of God’s Unity.
And that he should believe in the intercession
(<i>shafaʾa</i>) of the prophets, next of the learned
(<i>ʿulama</i>), next of the martyrs, next of the rest of
the believers—each according to his dignity and
rank with God Most High. And he who remains
of the believers, and has no intercessor, shall be
brought forth of the grace of God, whose are
Might and Majesty. So there shall not abide eternally
in the Fire a single believer, but whoever has
in his heart the weight of a single grain of faith
shall be brought forth therefrom. And that he
should confess the excellence of the Companions—May
God be well pleased with them—and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
rank; and that the most excellent of mankind, after
the Prophet is Abu Bakr, next Umar, next Uthman,
next Ali—May God be well pleased with
them; And that he should think well of all the
Companions and should praise them like as he
praises God, whose are Might and Majesty, and
His Apostles. All this is that which has been
handed down in tradition from the Prophet and in
narratives from the followers. He who confesses
all this, relying upon it, is of the People of the
Truth and the Company of the Sunna, and hath
separated himself from the band of error and the
sect of innovation (<i>bidʾa</i>). So we ask from God
perfection of certainty and firm standing in the
Faith (<i>din</i>) for us and for all Moslems through
His compassion.—Lo! He is the Most Compassionate!—and
may the blessing of God be upon our
Lord Mohammed and upon every chosen creature.”</p>

</div>

<p>The above is Doctor Macdonald’s careful translation
of what Al-Ghazali taught was involved
when Moslems say: <i>There is no God but Allah,
and Mohammed is Allah’s Apostle.</i> Surely he gave
this shortest of all creeds its full significance and
value.</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, not only to see in it the
faith of Al-Ghazali but his credulity as well, if we
desire to understand the man and his times. Once
his early scepticism was overcome, he was always
and everywhere an orthodox Moslem, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
swallowed the Traditions and the Koran apparently
without any philosophic doubt. He believed
that Mohammed was the greatest of all the
prophets, and that, so he says, “God has established
Mohammed’s prophetic character by miracles,
such as the splitting of the moon, and the
praising of him by stones, the gushing out of water
from between his fingers. One of the greatest
miracles, proving his divine mission, is the Koran,
for none of the Arabs were able to produce anything
like it. Another sign of his prophetic character
is his being able to foretell things which are to
come to pass, such as his victorious entry into
Mecca, the defeat of the Greeks and their subsequent
victories.” (See the special chapter in the
<i>Ihya</i> on this subject.)</p>

<p>He was a predestinarian in the fullest sense. In
one place he writes: “When God Almighty let
His hands pass over the back of Adam and gathered
men into His two hands, He placed some of
them in His right hand and the others in His left;
then He opened both His hands before Adam, and
Adam looked at them and saw them like imperceptible
atoms. Then God said: ‘These are destined
for Paradise and these are destined for hell-fire.’
He then asked them: ‘Am I not your
Lord?’ And they replied: ‘Certainly, we testify
that Thou art our Lord.’ God then asked Adam
and the angels to be witnesses to the act; after this
God replaced them into the loins of Adam. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
were at that time purely spiritual beings without
bodies. He then caused them to die, but gathered
them and kept them in a receptacle near His throne.
When the germ of a new being is placed in the
womb of the mother, it remains there till its body
is sufficiently developed; the soul in the same is
then dead yet. When God Almighty breathes into
the spirit, He restores to it its most precious part
of which it had been deprived while preserved in
the receptacle near the throne. This is the first
death and the second life. Then God places man
in this world till he has reached the term fixed for
him.”</p>

<p>The great Mystic was also superstitious. Some
of his books deal with magical formulæ taken from
the Koran and the medicinal use of its text or of
the names of God. One of the most celebrated
magic squares used on amulets, etc., is called the
“Square of Al-Ghazali” or <i>Al-Buduh</i>. It may interest
in conclusion to give an account of this form
of magic, approved by Al-Ghazali, because it is one
of the things by which he is best known among the
masses in the world of Islam.</p>

<p>In the older Arabic books on magic this formula
plays a comparatively minor part; but after it was
taken up by Al-Ghazali and cited in his <i>Munkidh</i>
(pp. 46 and 50 of ed. of Cairo, 1303) as an inexplicable,
but certain assistance in cases of difficult
labour, it came to be universally known as “the
three-fold talisman, or seal, or table of Al-Ghazali”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
(<i>al-wakf</i>, <i>al-khatam</i>, <i>al-jadwal</i>, <i>al-muthallath lil-Ghazali</i>)
and finally has become the starting point
for the whole “Science of Letters” (<i>ʿIlm ul-huruf</i>)
(<i>e. g.</i>, Cf. Al-Buni’s Shems ul Muʿarif, <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 622).
Al-Ghazali is said to have developed the formula,
under divine inspiration (<i>ilham</i>), from the combinations
of letters which open Suras xix. and xlii.
of the Koran, and which by themselves are also
used as talismans.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Others trace the formula back
to Adam, from whom it passed down to Al-Ghazali.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>For the popular mind <i>Buduh</i> has become a Jinn
whose services can be secured by writing his name
either in letters or numbers. The uses of the word
are most varied to invoke both good and bad fortune.
It is used against menorrhagia, against
pains in the stomach, to render oneself invisible,
against temporary impotence, etc. Lane’s Cairo
magician also used it with his ink mirror (“Modern
Egyptians,” chap. xii.). We find the same in
magical treatises. It is also engraved upon jewels
and metal plates or rings which are carried as permanent
talismans, and it is inscribed at the beginning
of books as a preservative. But by far the
most common use is to ensure the arrival of letters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
and packages.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> No letter from one pious Moslem
to another is ever posted in the Near East without
putting the figure 8642 in Arabic on the outside
of the envelope where it is sealed. And one may
see thousands of children in Egypt who have never
heard of Al-Ghazali and cannot read the letters of
his name wearing his magic square on lead or silver
amulet to protect them from the hideous power of
the Child-Witch (Um-as-Subyan). In the Azhar
University men study his creed but in the villages
they follow his credulity and to all the <i>fellahin</i> of
Egypt <i>Buduh</i> has become a guardian Angel!</p>

to them, ‘Have you had in your sects such a

and they both replied, ‘No.’ The Shaikh, the

said, when mention was made of Al-Ghazali,
‘Testimony has been already borne to his great and

<h3>VI<br>
HIS WRITINGS</h3>

<p>More by far is known of Al-Ghazali
from his writings than from the records
of his life. The meagre facts of the
biographers and even the spelling of his name, as
we have seen, are disputed. His pen, however, left
so large a legacy that many of his works are still
found only in rare manuscripts, and have never
been published. Moslem writers mention ninety-nine
works, and Brockelmann in his “History of
Arabic Literature” catalogues sixty-nine which are
still in existence. They include systems of theology,
eschatology, works on philosophy, lectures on
mysticism, on ethics, and on canon law.</p>

<p>Many have assigned to Al-Ghazali the highest
position among all Moslem writers. Ismael Ibn
Mohammed Al Hadrami says: “Mohammed the
son of Abdullah was the Prince of all the Prophets;
Mohammed the son of Idris Al-Shafiʾ was the
Prince of Imams; but Mohammed the son of Mohammed,
the son of Mohammed Al-Ghazali, was
the Prince of Writers.”</p>

<p>We have interesting evidence of Al-Ghazali’s
position as a writer even in his own day in the precious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
relic shown in our illustration. In the Arabic
Museum at Cairo there is a <i>maqlama</i> or pen-case
which once belonged to Al-Ghazali. It was presented
to the Museum by M. Kyticas and is made
of brass overlaid with silver. It bears the following
inscription: “<i>Made for the library of our Master,
the most great and noble Imam, our revered
Leader, the Mouthpiece of verity, the greatest
Scholar of the world, the King of wise men, the
Stay of all living, the Treasury of truth, the most
illustrious among his contemporaries, the Restorer
of religion</i>, [an illegible word] <i>Hujjat ul-Islam,
Mohammed Al-Ghazali.</i>”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus6.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Pen case of Al Ghazali, made of brass inlaid with silver,
preserved in the Arab Museum, Cairo.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This bronze is the oldest piece of damascened
metal work and the only example of that epoch
with <i>naskhi</i> inscription in the possession of the
Museum. That the case was not made at a later
period and presented to Al-Ghazali’s library <i>after</i>
his death is evident from the fact that it was the
custom to present a book or celestial globe to a
library, but not a pen-case or even an inkstand.
Then, too, the word “<i>al-marhum</i>,” meaning “deceased,”
does not appear on it as it does on other
objects which were offered in memory of a deceased
person. An objection to the authenticity
of the bronze is the use of silver in a pen-case designed
to be used by a Sufi doctor pledged in some
measure to an ascetic life. But this objection may
be answered by stating that the case was not made
to the order of Al-Ghazali personally, but by his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
disciples in order to obtain his good-will and patronage.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>We need not, moreover, be surprised at the apparent
lack of modesty which the inscription on the
pen-case indicates. Judging from other instances
of this period, Al-Ghazali himself might well have
written the inscription.</p>

<p>An almost complete list of Al-Ghazali’s writings
as well as of the translations of his works into other
languages, especially Hebrew, Latin, French, German,
and English, is given in the appendix.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Before
we speak of some of his more important works
a summary will interest the reader. The <i>Jawahir
al-Koran</i> (Jewels of the Koran) contains observations
on some of the verses of the Koran which
have special value; the <i>ʾAqida</i> is a statement of the
articles of the Moslem faith, and was published by
Pococke in his Specimen; the Precious Pearl (Al-Durrat
Al-Fakhira) is a treatise on the last judgment
and the end of the world, <i>i. e.</i>, his eschatology—and
has been translated and published by L.
Gautier. The morality and theology of the mystics
are codified in the <i>Ihya ʿulum id-din</i> (Revivification
of the Religious Sciences). The <i>Mizan Al-ʿamal</i>
(The Balance of Works) has been translated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
into Hebrew by Ibrahim bin Hasdai of Barcelona,
and published by Goldenthal. The <i>Kimiya as-saʾada</i>
(Alchemy of Happiness) is a popular lecture
founded on mysticism; this work which was
originally written in Persian, has been twice translated
into English, by H. A. Homes in 1873 and
more recently by Claud Field. <i>Ayyuha ’l-walad</i> (O
Child!) is a celebrated moral treatise, which has
been translated into German and published by Hammer-Purgstall.
Among works on jurisprudence,
his treatises on Shafiʾite law have earned great
reputation in the Moslem world; his <i>Basit</i>, <i>Wasit</i>,
and <i>Wajiz</i> are all abridgments of them. In the
domain of philosophy, the <i>Tahafut al-Falasifa</i>
(Collapse of the Philosophers) is an attack on the
adherents of the Greek Philosophy; it has been
edited by DeBoer. The <i>Maqasid al-Falasifa</i>
(Aims of the Philosophers) is a sort of introduction
to the above. The text has been published by
G. Beer, and a Latin translation by Gondisalvi is in
existence, which was printed in Venice in 1506.
<i>Al-Munqidh min ad-Dalal</i> (The Deliverer from
Error), written after the author commenced his
life as a teacher at Nishapur for the second time,
describes the development of his philosophy. It
was translated and published by Schmolders in his
“Essay on the Schools of Philosophy Among the
Arabs”; a second and greatly improved translation
was published in the <i>Journal Asiatique</i> for 1877, by
the learned savant, Barbier de Meynard. More recently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
it appeared in English under the title “The
Confessions of Al-Ghazali.” It is one of his
shortest but most famous books and can be compared
with the “Confessions” of St. Augustine, or
John Bunyan’s “Grace Abounding to the Chief
of Sinners.” Several of Al-Ghazali’s numerous
works are very brief, in the shape of epistles or
tractates.</p>

<p>Among his shorter works the following may be
mentioned: <i>Al-ʾAdab fi Din</i>, a short treatise on the
ethics of politeness, prepared for the use of his
pupils. It speaks of the ideal pupil, the ideal
teacher, of the ethics of eating, drinking, marriage
and the religious life. A smaller work already
mentioned is the <i>Risala Ayyuh’ Al-Walad</i> (“O
Child!”). In it he defines faith and works and
distinguishes between them. A curious passage
occurs in the introduction which reflects on Al-Ghazali’s
accuracy of statement, or at least raises
the question as to which “Gospel” he refers to. He
says: “O my child, live as you please for you are
already dead; love whom you wish, for you are
bound to be separated; and do what you will, for
you are sure to be judged for it. Verily I saw in
the Gospel of Jesus (upon Him be prayers and
peace) that He said, ‘From the hour in which the
dead is put upon the bier until the time when he
rests on the edge of the grave God will ask him
forty questions, the first of which is, O my servant,
you have purified yourself to appear before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
men many years and not for one hour have you
purified yourself for my gates, and every day a
voice was sounded in your ears saying, “What you
do for others why do you not do for me who surrounds
you with my mercy!” but you were deaf
and not willing to hear.’”</p>

<p>In his “Alchemy of Happiness” there is a beautiful
chapter on “Know Thyself.” The parable
there used regarding man’s soul and the enemies
that lay siege against it reminds one very much of
Bunyan’s “Holy War.” The shortest of his
works, as far as I am aware, is called <i>Al-Qawaʿid
Al-ʾAshara</i> (The Ten Articles); this has been
frequently reprinted. It consists of ten principles
of faith and conduct, and is scarcely longer than
an ordinary letter. Of a similar character is
<i>Risalat-ut-Tair</i> the parable of the birds. His most
celebrated treatise on ethics and conduct is entitled
<i>Mizan ul ʿAmal</i>. It might be compared to the
book of Ecclesiastes or the first chapters of the
book of Proverbs. In the introduction Al-Ghazali
shows the folly of those who neglect to secure the
happiness of their immortal souls as well as the
peril of those who despise faith in the world to
come. The true way of happiness consists in
knowing the right and doing it. The soul is a unit
and its various powers are knit together and are
interdependent. The path of the mystic unites true
faith with true practice. He also speaks of the
possibility of change of character through religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
devotion and mentions the virtues that are to be
cultivated and the vices to be shunned on this pathway
to God and to true happiness.</p>

<p>To emphasize the importance of life with its
brevity and the supreme importance of eternity
Al-Ghazali says: “Suppose we imagine that the
whole world is filled with dust and that a little bird
should come and snatch up one atom of dust every
thousand years. We know that there would be an
end of its task, but nothing would have been taken
away from the everlasting character of that eternity
which has no end.” Although the moral
teaching of this book is very noble, it is after all
based entirely on the principle of salvation by
works. There is no hint of the possibility of the
transformation of character through regeneration
of the heart, nor is the way pointed to the victorious
life by overcoming temptation through a power
that is not our own.</p>

<p>Of all his writings none is celebrated more justly
than his greatest work “The Revival of Religious
Sciences” (<i>Ihya ʿulum id Din</i>). It is a veritable
encyclopædia of Moslem teaching and ethics and
covers the whole range of Moslem thought. Many
editions of this work have been printed and commentaries
written on it, the most celebrated of
which is by Mohammed-uz-Zubeidi Al-Murtadha,
in ten large volumes. The work itself consists of
four volumes of ten books each and has a total of
over one thousand closely printed pages. Although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
widely read in its original form, popular demand
has called forth several abbreviated compendia of
the work. One of them entitled “A Homily for
Believers,” by Mohammed Jamal-ud-Din of Damascus,
is used as a text-book on Islam in the Theological
Seminary of the American Mission in
Cairo.</p>

<p>Especially the third and fourth parts of his
great work show us Al-Ghazali as a mystic and a
preacher of righteousness. His ten books on
“Things that deliver the soul” furnish material
from which it would not be difficult to collect a
beautiful anthology or a daily calendar of spiritual
thoughts. Such a rosary of pearls from Al-Ghazali’s
works might well be used for devotion by
Christians as well as by Moslems.</p>

<p>Another most interesting book is that on the
names of God, entitled <i>Al-Maksad ul-Asna Sharh-Asmaʾ-Allah
ul Husna</i>, “The Highest Aim: the
Explanation of the Beautiful Names of God.”
The book is divided into three parts of which the
first deals philosophically with the meaning of the
word “name” and its distinction from the naming
of the thing and the thing named itself: also
how it is possible for God to have many names and
yet to be one essence. The second part of the book
is the longest and treats of the ninety-nine names of
God in order showing how they are comprehended
in the seven attributes and the one essence. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
third part is brief and shows that there are really
more than ninety-nine names, but that this was the
number fixed upon for good reasons. And finally
there is a section telling how God may and may not
be described.</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali teaches in this book <i>that the imitation
of God’s attributes is the highest happiness for the
believer</i>. There are three degrees in the knowledge
of God, and in this respect he says: “The
virtues of the righteous are the faults of the
Saints”; by which he means that the nearer we
approach to God the more perfect is our standard
of character. The three degrees of knowledge are
(1) intellectual, (2) that of admiration and attempted
imitation, (3) that of actual acquirements
of God’s attributes such as the angels. Nearness
to God is by rank and degree, not in regard to position
or place. He quotes with approval the famous
saying of Junaid: “No one knows God save God
Himself Most High, and therefore even to the best
of His creatures He has only revealed His names,
in which He hides Himself.” He says that two
statements are true in regard to God and the
believer. The true believer must say, “I know
nothing but God,” and “I know nothing of
God.”</p>

<p>The last book Al-Ghazali wrote was the <i>Minhaj
al-ʾAbidin</i> or “Guide of True Worshippers.” It
is said to have been written for those who could not
understand the <i>Ihya</i> and deals with the creed and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
ritual of Islam from the standpoint of the mystic.
Our illustration shows in facsimile the first page of
this celebrated work from a recent Cairo edition.
On the margin of the text we have the Beginner’s
Guide, already spoken of. These two works of
Al-Ghazali are very popular and have recently had
an increasing circulation.</p>

<p>The <i>Minhaj</i> shows that Al-Ghazali at the close
of his life had adopted the vocabulary of the mystics
even for popular teaching. The various chapters
are called “stages” in the progress of the soul
towards salvation and peace. The first stage is
that of knowledge, then follows repentance, a list
of the hindrances on the road to God, things that
delay the soul in its onward progress, such as the
world and its allurements, the flesh, the devil, the
senses. Other hindrances are the cares of gaining
a living, the perplexities and troubles of life, while
the last stages in the road of the mystic are those
of praise to God under all circumstances, and earnest
endeavour to attain to the reality of the experience
of His presence.</p>

<p>So difficult is the road which Al-Ghazali describes
that he says: “Some seekers can only finish
these stages in seventy years, some in twenty, some
in ten. Others there are, however, whose souls are
so enlightened, so free from the care and perplexity
of the world, that they finish the journey and arrive
at the goal in a year, a month, what do I say, in an
hour; so that they awaken like the Companions of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
the Cave, and the change they see in themselves and
those about them is to them as a dream.”</p>

<p>His teaching on prayer as given in the <i>Ihya</i> certainly
rises very high above that of the ritualist
who puts all his attention on the punctiliousness of
outward observance. “Prayers are of three degrees,
of which the first are those that are simply
spoken with the lips. Prayers are of the second
kind when with difficulty, and only by a most resolute
effort, the soul is able to fix its thoughts on
divine things without being disturbed by evil imaginations;
they are of the third kind when one
finds it difficult to turn away the mind from dwelling
on divine things. But it is the very marrow of
prayer when He who is invoked takes possession of
the soul of the suppliant, and the soul of him who
prays is absorbed into God, to whom he prays, and,
his prayer ceasing, all consciousness of self has departed,
and to such a degree that all thought whatsoever
of the praying is felt as a veil between the
soul and God. This state is called by the Sufis
‘absorption,’ for the reason that the man is so absorbed
that he takes no thought of his body, or of
anything that happens externally, or even of the
movements of his own soul, but is first engaged in
going towards his Lord, and finally is wholly in his
Lord. If even the thought occurs that he is absorbed
in the Absolute it is a blemish, for that
absorption only is worthy of the name, though they
will be called, as I well know, but foolish babbling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
by raw theologians, are yet by no means without
significance. For consider: The condition of
which I speak resembles that of a person who loves
any other object, such as wealth, honour, or pleasure.
We see such persons so carried away with
their love, and others with their anger, that they do
not hear one who speaks to them, nor see those
passing before their eyes. Nay, so absorbed are
they in their passion that they do not perceive their
absorption; you necessarily turn it away from that
which is the object of it.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere Al-Ghazali says: “The commencement
of this life is the going to God; then follows
the finding Him, when the absorption takes place.
This at first is momentary, as the lightning swiftly
glancing upon the eye, but afterwards, confirmed
by use, it introduces the soul into a higher world,
where, the most pure essential essence meeting it,
fills the soul with the images of the spiritual world,
while the majesty of Deity discovers itself.”</p>

<p>The evident sincerity and the moral earnestness
of Al-Ghazali shown in his works and in the extracts
which we have quoted, surely explains in a
large degree why his influence has been so deep and
permanent, far greater than that of the merely intellectual
philosophers, such as Averroes. While
he discouraged scholastic philosophy, he encouraged
moral philosophy. The reader will remember
how he carried a book of ethics with him on his
journeys. After his death several famous ethical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
treatises were composed which derived much from
him. Claud Field says “the most important of
these is the ‘Akhlaq-i-Jalali,’ by Jalaluddin Asaʾad
Aldawani, which has been ably translated into
English by Mr. W. F. Thompson. The ‘Akhlaq-i-Jalali’
itself is largely a translation into Persian
from the Arabic, the original of which appeared in
the tenth century under the name of ‘Kitab-ut-Taharat.’
Two centuries after it was translated
into Persian by Abu Nasr, and named ‘Akhlaq
Nasiri,’ enriched with some important additions
from Avicenna. In the fifteenth century it assumed
a still further improved form under its present
name, the ‘Akhlaq-i-Jalali.’”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>That Al-Ghazali was a careful student of nature
is evident in all his writings. Those portions of
the Koran which deal with natural theology and
the proof of God’s existence from the starry
heavens, from the fertile ground, the animal creation,
and the sea with its terrors, especially seem to
appeal to him. One of his books is entitled <i>Al
Hikmat fi Makhlukat Allah</i> (The Wisdom of God
Shown in the Marvels of Creation). It is one of
his shorter writings but full of beautiful passages
on the glory of the starry heavens, the earth and
the sea, and the four primal elements. One long
chapter is devoted to embryology and the physical
wonders of the human frame. Another is on birds,
another on quadrupeds and on fishes. The conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
of the whole treatise is the argument from
design, for the goodness and greatness of the Creator
as shown in His works. What he says in regard
to the benefits to be obtained from gazing into
the starry vault may be compared with David’s
words in the eighth and the nineteenth Psalms.
Says Al-Ghazali: “To look up into the vault of
heaven drives away anxiety, removes the whisperings
of Satan, takes away idle fear, reminds us of
God, brings the heart to magnify Him, banishes
evil thoughts, cures pessimism, comforts the passionate,
delights the lover, and it is the best <i>Kibla</i>
for those who call to God in prayer.”</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali was also a dogmatic theologian and
controversialist. He wrote a commentary on the
Koran in forty volumes, never printed; and a dozen
books against various heretics, including one entitled:
“The Best Reply to Those Who Have Tampered
with the Gospel.” Al-Ghazali, who was
himself cursed for alleged heresy, is memorable
among the theologians of Islam in that by his
breadth of sympathy he forbade the cursing of
Yazid, the notorious slayer of Hussein, Mohammed’s
grandson, and gave his opinion in these
words: “It is forbidden to curse a Moslem: Yazid
was a Moslem. It is not certain that he slew Al-Husain,
and it is forbidden to think ill of a Moslem.
We cannot be certain that he ordered his
death; really we cannot be certain of the cause of
the death of any great man, especially at such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
distance of time. We have also to remember the
party spirit and false statements in this particular
case. Again, if he did kill him, he is not an unbeliever
because of that; he is only disobedient to
God. Again, he may have repented before he died.
Further, to abstain from cursing is no crime. No
one will be asked if he ever cursed Satan; if he has
cursed him he may be asked, Why? The only accursed
ones of whom we know are those who die
infidels.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Among his books against the philosophers we
must mention three which are closely related to
one another. They are the <i>Maqasid-ul-Falasifa</i>, a
statement of the true teachings of the philosophers
and a presentation of their views of the world; the
<i>Tahafut ul Falasifa</i> which overthrows their views
and shows that they are untenable to those who
would follow Islam with heart and mind; the
<i>Qawaʾid</i>, which shows the truths that must be built
up to take the place of the errors of the philosophers.
In the first-named book, according to
Macdonald, he “smites the philosophers hip and
thigh, turns their own weapons against them and
goes to the extreme of intellectual scepticism; seven
hundred years before Hume he cuts the bond
of causality with the edge of his dialectic and
proclaims that we can know nothing of cause
or effect, but simply that one thing follows another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>Al-Ghazali’s great work “The Revival of Religious
Sciences,” caused great scandal in Andalusia.
There the intolerance of the learned passed
all bounds because of the narrowness of their
views. Their theology was limited to minute
knowledge of Canon Law. They had no place
for the religion which Ghazali preached, which was
personal and passionate, a religion of the heart.
When he attacked contemporary theologians busy
with questions of legality and the externals of religion,
he touched these pharisees of the law at the
quick and they not only squirmed but screamed
loudly. According to Dozy, “the Kady of Cordova,
Ibn Hamdin, declared that any man who read
Al-Ghazali’s book was an infidel ripe for damnation,
and he drew up a <i>fatwa</i> condemning all copies
of the book to the flames. This <i>fatwa</i>, signed by
the <i>Fakihs</i> of Cordova, was formally approved by
ʾAli. Al-Ghazali’s book was accordingly burnt in
Cordova and all the other cities of the Empire, and
possession of a copy was interdicted on pain of
death and confiscation of property.”</p>

<p>But this opinion was not shared by Moslems
elsewhere. In his lifetime and especially after his
death his works against philosophy and his great
exposition of Islam found ever larger circles of
readers and commentators.</p>

<p>He has been accused, and not without good reason,
both by Moslem writers and European critics,
of carelessness and inaccuracy in his quotations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
and references to other books.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> One of the charges
brought against him by his assailants is that he
falsified Tradition. Macdonald’s judgment is very
charitable when he says that “he quoted from
memory too freely, because he was a man of too
large a calibre to watch his quotations and they
were loose to the end of his life.”</p>

<p>As-Subqi in his Tabakat-ash-Shafaʾiya al Kubra
devotes a special section to what is entitled “A List
of all the Traditions given by Al-Ghazali in his
<i>Ihya</i> which have no <i>isnad</i>, or pedigree, <i>i. e.</i>, Traditions
<i>quoted by him as authoritative and yet which
from the standpoint of Moslem criticism are on
this account absolutely worthless</i>.” This section of
the book referred to covers many pages and by
actual count I found over six hundred Traditions
each catalogued by reference to the chapter in
which they occur. Now we have no reason to
doubt that As-Subqi (d. 771 <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span>) was an admirer
of Al-Ghazali and esteemed his teaching, yet
what shall we say when in this collection of the
lives of the saints so strong an indictment is made
of Al-Ghazali’s inaccuracy by one of his own disciples?</p>

<p>When reading this collection of “true sayings”
of the Prophet (which are after all often ascribed
to him without any authority or foundation) one is
shocked both at the credulity and the lack of love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
for veracity in this greatest of all Moslem apologists.
If even Al-Ghazali handled Tradition so
carelessly as to ascribe to Mohammed so much that
is altogether puerile, fabulous and often immoral,
what confidence can we put in other and later tradition-mongers
and how can we clear Al-Ghazali
from the charge of using pious falsehood?</p>

<p>We add another fact of great interest in regard
to his writings. Al-Ghazali exercised a commanding
influence on Jewish thought in the Middle
Ages. In the appendix is a list of some of the
translations of his books made in Hebrew. Jewish
students of philosophy, including Maimonides,
drew many of their theories from the <i>Maqasid</i> and
his other works. Al-Ghazali’s attacks on philosophy
were imitated by Judah ha-Levy in his
<i>Cuzari</i>; but it was chiefly his ethical teaching rather
than through his philosophy that Al-Ghazali attracted
the Jewish thinkers. Broyde says, “He
approached the ethical ideal of Judaism to such an
extent that some supposed him to be actually drifting
in that direction, and his works were eagerly
studied and used by Jewish writers. Abraham ibn
Ezra borrowed from Al-Ghazali’s <i>Mizan al ʿAmal</i>
his comparison between the limbs of the human
body and the functionaries of a king, and used it
for the subject of his beautiful admonition <i>Yeshene
Leb</i>; Abraham ibn Dawud borrowed from the same
work the parable used by Al-Ghazali to prove the
difference in value between various branches of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
science; and Simon Duran cites in his <i>Keshet</i> a passage
from the <i>Mozene ha-ʾIyyunim</i>, which he calls
<i>Mozene ha-Hokmah</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The translations of his works into Hebrew were
made as early as the thirteenth century. Not less
than <i>eleven</i> Hebrew commentaries are known on
the <i>Maqasid</i>. “Johanan Alemanno recommends
Ghazali’s hermeneutic methods, and compares
the order and graduation of lights in Ghazali’s
theory with those of the theory of the cabalists.”</p>

<p>In regard to science, Al-Ghazali’s views were
naturally those of his contemporaries. His world
was built on the Ptolemaic system. There are
four elements only. Existence has three modes:
the world of sense, the world of God’s eternal decree,
and the world of ideals or of God’s power.
In dreams and visions we are in contact with the
two other worlds. Al-Ghazali avoids the difficulties
of concrete Moslem teaching by this method.
There may be things which are real and actual and
yet do not belong to the world of sense.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Doctor Macdonald admirably summarizes his
influence on Islam as four-fold. “First of all he
led men back from mere scholastic dogma to a living
contact with the Koran and the Traditions as
the true source of Islam. He might be called a
Biblical theologian in our modern use of the word,
understanding by ‘Bible’ always the Moslem bible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
namely the Koran. Nearly every paragraph of
his <i>Ihya</i> begins with a Koran quotation, and his
interpretation of the book is not a slavish following
of the earlier commentators but a spiritual interpretation
of the text.”</p>

<p>“In the second place he reintroduced into Islam
the element of fear. In the earliest days, as for
example in the Koran itself, the terrors of the day
of judgment and the horrors of hell operated in
order to lead men to repentance. Al-Ghazali emphasized
this part of the Moslem teaching to the
utmost, witness his little book <i>Al-Durra al-Fakhira</i>,
which has to this day great acceptance among
pious Moslems.”</p>

<p>In the third place mysticism, already existing in
Islam, but looked upon in many quarters as heretical,
received its birthright through Al-Ghazali’s
life and teachings, and from his day on held an
assured position in orthodox Islam.</p>

<p>Lastly, he brought philosophy within the range
of the ordinary mind, warning the people against
its dangers as well as showing them its fundamental
principles and above all illustrating through his
writings how true philosophy and true Islam are
not contradictory. In this respect he resembles
Raymond Lull who also desired to use philosophy
as the handmaid of Christianity.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>Macdonald thinks that of these four phases of
his work and influence the first and the third were
undoubtedly the most important. These alone
made him a reformer of the first rank in the history
of Islam.</p>

<p>“The religion of Christ contains whole fields of
morality and whole realms of thought which are all
but outside the religion of Mohammed. It opens
humility, purity of heart, forgiveness of injuries,
sacrifice of self to man’s moral nature; it gives scope
for toleration, development, boundless progress to his
mind; its motive power is stronger, even as a friend
is better than a king and love higher than obedience.
Its realized ideals in the various paths of human
greatness have been more commanding, more many-sided,
more holy, as Averroes is below Newton,
Haroun below Alfred, and ʾAli below St. Paul.
Finally, the ideal life of all is far more elevating, far
more majestic, far more inspiring even as the life of
the founder of Mohammedanism is below the life of
the Founder of Christianity.”</p>

<h3>VII<br>
HIS ETHICS</h3>

<p>Martensen defines Christian ethics as
“the science of morals conditioned by
Christianity.” But the three fundamental
concepts of Christian ethics are all of them
challenged by the teaching of Islam. The Mohammedan
idea of the Highest Good, of Virtue
and of the Moral Law are not in accord with those
of Christianity. This is evident both from the
character of Mohammed himself and from his recorded
sayings. Ideal virtue is to be found
through imitation of Mohammed. And the moral
law is practically abrogated because of loose views
as to its real character, its teaching and finality.
“The ethics of Islam bear the character of an outwardly
and crudely conceived doctrine of righteousness;
conscientiousness in the sphere of the social
relations, faithfulness to conviction and to one’s
word, and the bringing of an action into relation to
God, are its bright points; but there is a lack of
heart-depth, of a basing of the moral in love. The
highest good is the very outwardly and very sensuously
conceived happiness of the individual.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>This statement needs no proof to those who
know Islam from its original sources, the Koran
and Tradition. Professor Margoliouth uses language
which is strong but not unfair when he says
in regard to the saints of the Moslem calendar—that
is the companions and followers of Mohammed—“Those
who recount the history of Islam
have to lay aside all ordinary canons of morality,
else the picture would have no lights; they could
not write at all if they let themselves be shocked by
perfidy or bloodthirstiness, by cruelty or lust, yet
both the Koran and Tradition forbid the first three,
and assign some limits to the fourth.” A stream
cannot rise higher than its source; a tower cannot
be broader than its foundation. The measure of
the moral stature of Mohammed is the source and
foundation of all moral ideals in Islam. His conduct
is the standard of character. We need not be
surprised, therefore, that the ethical standard is so
low even in Al-Ghazali, although he ofttimes rises
high above the Koran and the Prophet.</p>

<p>In nearly every one of his books on morals the
Prophet of Arabia is held up as the highest ideal
of character. In his “Precious Pearl,” however,
there is a passage quoted from a tradition in which
he pays this high tribute to Jesus Christ (page 24,
Cairo Edition), “<i>Go to Jesus, on Him be peace, for
He is the truest of those who were sent as apostles,
and who knew most of God, and the most ascetic in
life of them all, and the most eloquent of all in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
wisdom, perchance He will intercede for you.</i>”
The quotation, however, refers to the day of resurrection
when the various nations seek God’s favour
and forgiveness.</p>

<p>When we consider the age in which Al-Ghazali
lived and his Moslem education in ethics, Macdonald
says,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> “the position of Al-Ghazali is a simple one.
All our laws and theories upon the subject,
the analysis of the qualities of the mind, good and
bad, the tracing of hidden defects to their causes,
and the methods of combating these causes,—all
these things [Al-Ghazali teaches] we owe to the
saints of God to whom God Himself has revealed
them. Of these there have been many at all times
and in all countries,—God has never left Himself
without a witness,—and without them and their
labours and the light which God has vouchsafed to
them we could never know ourselves. Here as
everywhere, comes out clearly Al-Ghazali’s fundamental
position that the ultimate source of all
knowledge is revelation from God. It may be
major revelation, through accredited prophets who
come forward as teachers, divinely sent and supported
by miracles and by the evident truth of their
message appealing to the human heart; or it may
be minor revelation—subsidiary and explanatory—through
the vast body of saints of different grades
to whom God has granted immediate knowledge of
Himself. Where the saints leave off, the prophets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
begin; and, apart from such teaching, man, even in
physical science, would be groping in the dark.”</p>

<p>But we must add to this clear statement of Al-Ghazali’s
theory of ethics, <i>lest it be wholly misunderstood</i>,
that the revelation referred to is the
Koran and that “the saints” were the Moslem
saints of the early Caliphate, and their followers.</p>

<p>Moslem doctors of jurisprudence, including Al-Ghazali,
define sin as “a conscious act of a responsible
being against known law.” Therefore sins
of ignorance and of childhood are not reckoned as
real sin. They divide sin into “great” and “little”
sins. Some say there are seven great sins:
idolatry, murder, false charge of adultery, wasting
the substance of orphans, taking interest on money,
desertion from <i>Jihad</i> and disobedience to parents.
Others say there are seventeen, and include wine-drinking,
witchcraft and perjury among them.
The lack of all distinction between the ceremonial
and the moral law is very evident in the traditional
sayings of Mohammed, which are, of course, at the
basis of ethics. Take one example: “The Prophet,
upon him be prayers and peace, said, One <i>dirhem</i>
of usury which a man takes knowing it to be so
is more grievous than thirty-six fornications,
and whosoever has done so is worthy of hell-fire.”</p>

<p>Orthodox Moslems divide sins into greater and
lesser. Al-Ghazali quotes one who said, “There
are no greater and lesser sins, but everything which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
is contrary to God’s will is a great sin,” but gives
Koran passages contradicting this and then escapes
the moral difficulty by showing that the smaller
sins may become great if we continue in them:
“like the dropping of water wearing away a
stone”; and “when the servant of God reckons his
sin great, God reckons it small, and when he
reckons it small, then God reckons it great.”</p>

<p>He divides the sins which overcome the heart
into four classes: egoistic, satanic, brutal and cruel.
Under the first he puts pride, conceit, boasting,
selfishness, etc.; envy, hatred, deceit, malice, corruption
and unbelief, belong to the second; while
greed, gluttony, lust, adultery, sodomy, theft, and
the robbing of orphans are classed as brutal sins;
and anger, passion, abuse, cursing, murder, robbery,
etc., are cruel.</p>

<p>Yet in all of Al-Ghazali’s works on ethics and
many of his smaller treatises are on this subject,
there is no clear distinction made between the ritual
and the moral law. In fact one word used for
ethics in Arabic (<i>ʾadab</i>) refers to propriety of conduct,
etiquette, politeness, and decency in outward
behaviour, reverence in the presence of superiors,
rather than to the keeping of the ten commandments
or of the principles that are fundamental to
noble character. This becomes very clear when we
study the contents, for example, of one of his
shorter books entitled <i>Al-ʾAdab fi Din</i> (Ethics in
Religion).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>The book begins by giving the basis of ethical
teaching in these words: “Praise be to God who
created us and perfected our creation, and taught
us morals and beautified our morals, and honoured
us by sending His Prophet Mohammed (upon
whom may God’s blessing rest), and hath taught
us how to honour him. Truly the most perfect element
in character and the most elevated, and the
best of good works, and the most glorious, is correct
behaviour as regards religion, which teaches
what a true believer should know of the work of
the Lord of the worlds and the Creator of the
prophets and apostles; and God hath taught us and
clearly enlightened us concerning this in the Koran,
and hath given us the example of conduct in his
Prophet Mohammed according to his Traditions.
He is our example, and likewise are his companions
and immediate followers. These have shown us
what it is necessary for us to follow in their conduct,
which we have here recorded for all those
who would follow.”</p>

<p>The paragraphs or sections of this handbook
are entitled: Ethics of the believer in the presence
of God; of the teacher; of the pupil; of those who
hear the Koran read; of the reader; of the school-teacher;
of those who seek to understand Tradition;
of the scribe; of the preacher; of the ascetic;
of the nobleman; ethics of sleeping; of night-watching;
of fulfilling a call of nature; of the bath;
of washing; of entering the mosque; of the call to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
prayer; of prayer; of intercession; of the Friday
sermon; of the feast-days; of conduct during an
eclipse; of conduct during drought; of sickness; of
funerals; of almsgiving; of the rich and the poor;
of fasting; of pilgrimage; of the merchant; of the
money-changer; of eating and drinking; of marriage
(this has several subdivisions); of sitting by
the wayside; of the child with its parents; of the
parent with the child; of brothers; of neighbours;
of the master with the servant; of the Sultan with
his subjects; of the Judge; of the witness; of the
prisoner. The final chapter of this interesting
treatise deals with miscellaneous maxims on polite
behaviour under all circumstances.</p>

<p>A translation of the section on eating, which is
about the same length as the other paragraphs, will
give a clear idea of the contents: “One should
wash one’s hands before partaking of food and
after, and pronounce the name of God before beginning
to eat, and eat with the right hand. Take
small portions from the dish, chew the food thoroughly,
and do not look into the faces of the other
guests while you are eating; nor should you recline
nor eat to excess beyond the demands of hunger;
and you should ask to be excused as soon as you
have had enough, so that your guest may not be
embarrassed or any one who has greater need. And
one should eat from the edge of the platter and not
from the middle, and wipe his fingers after the
meal, and return praise to God. Nor should one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
mention death at dinner for fear of bringing bad
luck upon those who are present.”</p>

<p>All this is interesting and important, for the
Moslem child, as table etiquette. Obedience, humility
in outward behaviour, reverence in the
mosque, respect “to those above us in age or station,”
and many other social virtues are likewise
commended. But the omissions of the Book surprise
us. There is nothing on truth, heart-purity,
moral courage or the nobility of chivalry—<i>the
things that make a man</i>.</p>

<p>One section of the <i>Ihya</i> (Vol. III, p. 96 ff.)
deals with the question as to when lies are justifiable,
and clearly shows that according to Al-Ghazali,
in the realm of truth at least, the end justifies
the means. “Know,” he says, “that a lie is not
<i>haram</i> (wrong) in itself, but only because of the
evil conclusions to which it leads the hearer, making
him believe something that is not really the
case. Ignorance sometimes is an advantage, and if
a lie causes this kind of ignorance it may be allowed.
It is sometimes a duty to lie. Maimun
Ibn Muhran said, ‘A lie is sometimes better than
truth: for instance, if you see a man seeking for
another in order to kill him, what do you reply to
the question as to where he is? Of course you will
reply thus, for such a lie is lawful. We say that
the end justifies the means.’</p>

<p>“If lying and truth both lead to a good result,
you must tell the truth, for a lie is forbidden in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
case. If a lie is the only way to reach a good result,
it is allowable (<i>hallal</i>). A lie is lawful when
it is the only path to duty. For example, if a Moslem
flees from an unjust one and you are asked
about him, you are obliged to lie in order to save
him. If the outcome of war, reconciliation between
two separated friends, or the safety of an
oppressed depends on a lie, then a lie is allowed.
In all cases we must be careful not to lie when there
is no necessity for it, lest it be <i>haram</i> (wrong). If
a wicked person asks a man about his wealth he
has to deny having any; and so if a sultan asks a
man about a crime he has committed, he has to
deny it and say, ‘I have not stolen,’ when he did
steal; ‘nor done any vice,’ when he has done. The
Prophet said, ‘He who has done a shameful deed
must conceal it, for revealing one disgrace is another
disgrace.’ A person must deny the sins of
others as well. Making peace between wives is a
duty, even by pretending to each of them that she
is loved the most, and by making promises to please
her.</p>

<p>“We must lie when truth leads to unpleasant results,
but tell the truth when it leads to good results.
Lying for one’s pleasure, or for increase of
wealth, or for fame is forbidden. One wife must
not lie for her husband to tease another wife. Lying
is allowed in persuading children to go to
school; also false promises and false threats.”</p>

<p>We get another view of Al-Ghazali’s ethics in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
teaching regarding education. There is a special
section in the <i>Ihya</i> (Vol. III, p. 53) which deals
with the education of boys and the improvement of
their morals. It is not surprising that nothing is
said as regards the education of girls, for even now
many Moslem authorities consider it inadvisable
that they should be taught to read and write. The
chapter referred to begins as follows:</p>

<p>“It is most important to know how to bring up
a boy, for a boy is a trust in the hands of his father,
and his pure heart is a precious jewel like a tablet
without inscription. It is therefore ready to receive
whatever impression is applied. If he learns
to do good and is taught it, he grows up accordingly,
and is happy in this world and the next and
his parents and teachers will have the reward for
their action. But if he learns evil and grows up in
neglect like the dumb cattle, he will turn away
from the truth and perish, and his sin will be on
the neck of his guardian. Allah has said, ‘O ye
who believe, guard yourselves and your family
from the fire; and even as the father would guard
his son from the fire of this world, by how much
the more should he guard him from the fire of the
world to come? He will guard him from it by
chastising him and educating him and teaching him
the best virtues. To this end he will only give his
boy to be nursed by a good, pious woman who eats
the proper food, for the milk from forbidden food
has no blessing in it.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>He then goes on to show that the education of a
child consists in teaching him table manners, the
avoidance of unclean food, gluttony and impoliteness.
He advises parents to dress their children
simply and not in costly clothing. To quote once
more:</p>

<p>“After teaching him these things it is wise to
send him to school where he shall learn the Koran
and the pious traditions, and the tales of the
righteous and their lives, in order that a love of
the pious may be imprinted in his heart; and he
should be kept from reading erotic poetry and prevented
from mixing with those people of education
who think that this sort of reading is profitable and
elevating, because, on the contrary, it produces in
the hearts of children the seeds of corruption.
Whenever the boy shows a good character or an
act which is praiseworthy, he must be honoured for
it and rewarded, so that he will be happy; and this
should especially be done in the presence of others.
If, on the contrary, he should act otherwise once
and again, it is necessary to take no notice of it,
nor to lay bare his fault, as though you imagine no
one would dare to do such a thing, especially if the
boy himself conceals it, and has determined to
hide it; for exposing would only make him more
bold in the future. If he should repeat the fault,
he can be punished in secret.”</p>

<p>Such is the strange ethical teaching—a mingling
of good and bad advice—on the part of one who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
has always been considered as the pillar of orthodoxy
and one of the great authorities on Moslem
morals.</p>

<p>The ethics of marriage holds a large place in
Moslem literature, and also in the works of Al-Ghazali.
Marriage is enjoined upon every Moslem,
and celibacy is discouraged. “Marriage,” said
Mohammed the Prophet, “is my custom, and he
who dislikes it does not belong to my people.”
And in another tradition: “Marriage is one-half
of true religion.” Even the members of the ascetic
orders in Islam are generally married. The vow
of celibacy was therefore not known among the
mystics. Marriage is defined by Moslem jurists as
“a contract by which the husband obtains possession
of the wife and is allowed to enjoy her, if
there be no legal impediment preventing the same.”
“Marriage,” says Al-Ghazali himself, “is a kind
of slavery, for the wife becomes the slave of her
husband and it is her duty to obey him absolutely
in everything he requires of her, except in what is
contrary to the laws of Islam.”</p>

<p>In the selection of a wife, Al-Ghazali advises his
disciples to look for the following qualifications:
(1) piety, (2) good character, (3) beauty, (4) a
moderate dowry, (5) ability to bear children,
(6) that she be a virgin, (7) of a good family,
(8) that she be not of near relation. The duties of
the husband to the wife and the duties of the wife
to her husband are given in detail by Al-Ghazali in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
his <i>Ihya</i> and in some of his other works. The husband,
according to this teaching, ought to maintain
<i>a golden mean</i> in dealing with his wife in
twelve points, that is, he means that there should
be no excess of kindness or excess of harshness in
any of these particulars: (1) the marriage feast;
(2) behaviour; (3) playfulness or caressing;
(4) maintaining his dignity; (5) jealousy; (6)
pecuniary allowance; (7) teaching; (8) granting
every wife her rights (in the Moslem sense);
(9) chastisement; (10) the rules of cohabitation;
(11) childbirth; (12) divorce. In one place he
says if the wife be disobedient and obstinate, the
husband has the right to punish her and force her
to obey him, but he must proceed gradually, exhort,
admonish, threaten, abstain from intercourse
with her for three days, beat her so as to let her
feel the pain, but be careful not to wound her in
the face, make her blood flow abundantly or break
a bone! The teaching of Al-Ghazali on divorce
and slavery is so thoroughly Moslem that much of
it is untranslatable. Suffice it to say that he agrees
with other doctors of Moslem law in excusing
onanism and other sins under certain circumstances,
and even indicates that it may become a
duty if practiced in order to escape from greater
sins.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>In spite of his Islamic conception of the sexual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
relation, Al-Ghazali certainly inspires our respect
by what he says on the kindly treatment of the wife
and the evil of divorce. Only one would like to
know whether he himself had more than one wife
and whether she was a worthy helpmeet to her
husband and he to her. His biographers are
silent.</p>

<p>“A man should remain on good terms with his
wife. This does not mean that he should never
cause her pain, but that he should bear any annoyance
she causes him, whether by her unreasonableness
or ingratitude, patiently. Woman is created
weak, and requiring concealment; she should therefore
be borne with patiently, and kept secluded.
The Prophet said, ‘He who bears the ill-humour
of his wife patiently will earn as much merit as
Job did by the patient endurance of his trials.’ On
his deathbed also he was heard to say, ‘Continue
in prayer and treat your wives well, for they are
your prisoners.’</p>

<p>“Wise men have said, ‘Consult women, and act
the contrary to what they advise.’ In truth there
is something perverse in women, and if they are
allowed even a little license, they get out of control
altogether, and it is difficult to reduce them to order
again. In dealing with them one should endeavour
to use a mixture of severity and tenderness, with a
greater proportion of the latter. The Prophet said,
‘Woman was formed of a crooked rib; if you try
to bend her, you will break her; if you leave her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
alone, she will grow more and more crooked; therefore
treat her tenderly.’<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>“The greatest care should be taken to avoid
divorce, for, though divorce is permitted, yet God
disapproves of it, because the very utterance of the
word ‘divorce’ causes a woman pain, and how can
it be right to pain any one? When divorce is absolutely
necessary, the formula for it should not be
repeated thrice all at once, but on three different
occasions. A woman should be divorced kindly,
not through anger and contempt, and not without a
reason. After divorce a man should give his former
wife a present, and not tell others that she has
been divorced for such and such a fault. Of a
certain man who was instituting divorce proceedings
against his wife it is related that people asked
him, ‘Why are you divorcing her?’ He answered,
‘I do not reveal my wife’s secrets.’ When he had
actually divorced her, he was asked again, and said,
‘She is a stranger to me now; I have nothing to do
with her private affairs.’”</p>

<p>All the relations of life, its pleasures and duties
pass under review in books on <i>ʾAdab</i>. Every detail
of outward conduct is regulated by what is
said to have been the practice of the Prophet. How
to eat a pomegranate correctly, how to take a bath,
how to use the <i>Miswak</i>, or tooth-brush, how to
behave towards Jews and Christians, and what
ornaments are allowed—all this comes under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
head of Moslem Ethics. We give the reader one
striking example.</p>

<p>In his work, “The Alchemy of Happiness,”
there is a chapter concerning “Music and Dancing
as Aids to the Religious Life.” The question of
musical instruments was discussed as earnestly in
the days of Al-Ghazali as it has been more recently
among Christians who dread the desecration of
God’s house by the “cist of whistles.” There was
much dispute among theologians as to the lawfulness
of music and dancing as religious exercises.
The Sufis had already introduced the practice.
The following paragraphs show Al-Ghazali’s common
sense, keen humour, and at the same time his
rather doubtful conclusion; for he even justifies
erotic poetry if sung for the glory of God:</p>

<p>“The heart of man has been so constituted by
the Almighty that, like a flint, it contains a hidden
fire which is evoked by music and harmony, and
renders man beside himself with ecstasy. These
harmonies are echoes of that higher world of
beauty which we call the world of spirits; they
remind man of his relationship to that world, and
produce in him an emotion so deep and strange that
he himself is powerless to explain it. The effect
of music and dancing is deeper in proportion as the
nature on which they act are simple and prone to
emotion; they fan into a flame whatever love is already
dormant in the heart, whether it be earthly
and sensual, or divine and spiritual....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>“Passing over the cases where music and dancing
rouse into a flame evil desires already dormant
in the heart, we come to those cases where they are
quite lawful. Such are those of the pilgrims who
celebrate the glories of the House of God at Mecca
in song, and thus incite others to go on pilgrimage,
and of minstrels whose music and songs stir up
martial ardour in the breasts of their auditors and
incite them to fight against the infidels. Similarly,
mournful music which excites sorrow for sin and
failure in the religious life is lawful; of this nature
was the music of David. But dirges which increase
sorrow for the dead are not lawful, for it
is written in the Koran, ‘Despair not over what
you have lost.’ On the other hand, joyful music
at weddings and feasts and on such occasions as a
circumcision or the return from a journey is lawful....</p>

<p>“The states of ecstasy into which the Sufis fall
vary according to the emotions which predominate
in them—love, fear, desire, repentance, etc. These
states, as we have mentioned above, are often the
result not only of hearing verses of the Koran, but
erotic poetry. Some have objected to the reciting
of poetry, as well as of the Koran, on these occasions;
but it should be remembered that all the
verses of the Koran are not adapted to stir the
emotions—such, for instance, as that which commands
that a man should leave his mother the sixth
part of his property and his sister the half, or that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
which orders that a widow must wait four months
after the death of her husband before becoming
espoused to another man. The natures which can
be thrown into religious ecstasy by the recital of
such verses are peculiarly sensitive and very rare.”
They certainly are!</p>

<p>The inconsistencies and contradictions in Al-Ghazali’s
theory of conduct surprise us when we
peruse his works. Sometimes he leads us to high
mountain ranges whose summits are gilded with
the light of heaven, the great truths of Theism, the
ideals of eternity; and again he plunges us into the
sloughs of sensuous and worldly discussion—themes
unworthy of his pen.</p>

<p>Let us get back to the mountain tops where the
air is healthier. Al-Ghazali, whatever may have
been his failure in other respects, had high ideals
for the attainment of morals from the Moslem
standpoint. In his “The Alchemy of Happiness”
he says, “When in the crucible of abstinence the
soul is purged from carnal passions it attains to the
highest, and in place of being a slave to lust and
anger becomes endued with angelic qualities. Attaining
that state, man finds his heaven in the contemplation
of Eternal Beauty, and no longer in
fleshly delights. The spiritual alchemy which
operates this change in him, like that which transmutes
base metals into gold, is not easily discovered,
nor to be found in the house of every old
woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>And in the attainment of this ideal he is sure
that there must be a fight for character. The
goal is not to be reached by easy stages. The warfare
against passion is real and costs sacrifice. He
gives us a picture of this Holy War almost in the
language of John Bunyan. “For the carrying on
of this spiritual warfare by which the knowledge
of oneself and of God is to be obtained, the body
may be figured as a kingdom, the soul as its king
and the different senses and faculties as constituting
an army. Reason may be called the vizier, or
prime minister, passion the revenue-collector, and
anger the police-officer. Under the guise of collecting
revenue, passion is continually prone to
plunder on its own account, while resentment is
always inclined to harshness and extreme severity.
Both of these, the revenue-collector and the police-officer,
have to be kept in due subordination to the
king, but not killed or expelled, as they have their
own proper functions to fulfil. But if passion and
resentment master reason, the ruin of the soul infallibly
ensues. A soul which allows its lower
faculties to dominate the higher is as one who
should hand over an angel to the power of a dog
or a Mussalman to the tyranny of an unbeliever.”</p>

<p>The struggle is, therefore, between the flesh and
the spirit. Like St. Paul, Al-Ghazali must have
experienced that which he describes: “The good
that I would I do not, and the evil that I would
not, that I do.” He is conscious of the inner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
struggle between the higher and the lower natures
in man. Again and again he contrasts the body
and the soul as to their eternal value in their
struggle for supremacy. Both are of God, His
gift to us; both show His wisdom and His power;
but there is no comparison when we try to estimate
their real values.</p>

<p>“The body, so to speak, is simply the riding
animal of the soul, and perishes while the soul endures.
The soul should take care of the body, just
as a pilgrim on his way to Mecca takes care of his
camel; but if the pilgrim spends his whole time in
feeding and adorning his camel, the caravan will
leave him behind, and he will perish in the desert.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The four leading virtues—the mothers of all
other good qualities—Al-Ghazali says are “Wisdom,
temperance, bravery, and moderation (or the
golden mean of conduct).”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> This classification he
has borrowed from Plato with so much else on the
theory of conduct. He explains all these virtues
in terms of the Koran and illustrates them from
the lives of Mohammed and the early saints of
Islam as well as the later mystics.</p>

<p>He is at his best when he speaks of vices and
their opposite virtues. No one can read his chapter
against pride and boasting without seeing that
he gives us again a page from his own experience.
He begins by quoting the saying of the Prophet,
“No one shall enter paradise in whose heart there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
is the weight of a grain of mustard seed of pride.”
And another saying, “Said God Most High,
‘Pride is my mantle and majesty is my cloak, and
whosoever takes away one of them from me I will
cast him into hell, and I care not.’” Another saying
attributed to Mohammed is evidently taken
from the Gospel, “Whoso humbleth himself before
God, God will exalt him, and whosoever is
proud God will bring him low.” His definition of
humility is beautiful: “True humility is to be subject
to the truth and to be corrected by it even
though thou shouldst hear it from a mere boy on
the street.” In this connection he quotes also a
saying of Jesus: “Said the Messiah (upon Him
be peace), ‘Blessed is he to whom God has taught
His book. He shall never die in his pride.’”</p>

<p>Pride is shown in different ways. Al-Ghazali
enumerates pride of knowledge, of worship, of
race and blood, of beauty and dress, of wealth, of
bodily strength, of leadership. He quotes Mohammed
as an example of humility, and also Abi
Saeed el Khudri, who said, “Oh, my son, eat unto
God and drink unto God and dress unto God. But
whatsoever thou doest of all of these and there
enters into them pride or hypocrisy it is disobedience.
Whatever you do in your house do it yourself
as did the Apostle of God, for he used to milk
the goats and patch his sandals and sew his cloak
and eat with the servants and buy in the bazaar,
nor did his pride forbid him carrying his own packages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
home; and he was friendly to the rich and to
the poor and he gave greetings himself first to every
one whom he met, etc.”</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that when he rises to the highest
ethical teaching he bases his remarks on the sayings
(mostly apocryphal) of Christ, which we collate
in our final chapter. Al-Ghazali tried hard but
failed to find in Mohammed the ideals of his own
heart. This is the tragedy of Islam.</p>

<p>“Mysticism is religion, and supplies a refuge for
men of religious minds who find it no longer possible
for them to rest on ‘external authority’—as George
Tyrrell both expounded and illustrated for us. Once
turn away from revelation and little choice remains
to you but the choice between Mysticism and Rationalism.
There is not so much choice between these
things, it is true, as enthusiasts on either side are apt
to imagine. The difference between them is very
much a matter of temperament, or perhaps we may
even say of temperature. The Mystic blows hot, the
Rationalist cold. Warm up a Rationalist and you
inevitably get a Mystic; chill down a Mystic and you
find yourself with a Rationalist on your hands. The
history of thought illustrates repeatedly the easy passage
from one to the other. Each centers himself in
himself, and the human self is not so big that it makes
any large difference where within yourself you take
your center. Nevertheless just because Mysticism
blows hot, its ‘eccentricity’ is the more attractive
to men of lively religious feeling.”</p>

<h3>VIII<br>
AL-GHAZALI AS A MYSTIC</h3>

<p>One of the earliest mystics in Islam was
Rabiaʾ, who was buried in Jerusalem.
She was a native of Busrah and died at
Jerusalem as early as the second century of Islam.
Her tomb, according to Ibn Khallikan, was an object
of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages, and was
probably visited by Al-Ghazali. The following
verses are quoted from her in the <i>Ihya</i> (vol. iv.
p. 298):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Two ways I love Thee: selfishly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And next, as worthy is of Thee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis selfish love that I do naught</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save think on Thee with every thought:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis purest love when Thou dost raise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The veil to my adoring gaze.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not mine the praise in that or this,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thine is the praise in both, I wis.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Moslem mystics, or <i>Sufis</i>, however, received
their name through Abu Khair, who lived at the
end of the second century of the Hegira. His
disciples wore a woolen garment, and from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
word <i>suf</i>, which means wool, they obtained their
name. In the next century, al-Junaid (<span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 297),
one of Al-Ghazali’s favourite authorities, was the
great leader of the movement, which spread
throughout Islam. It was a reaction from the
barren monotheism and the rigid ritualism of
Islam. This kind of orthodoxy did not meet the
needs of the more imaginative mind of the Eastern
races who accepted Islam. The preachers of the
new doctrine travelled everywhere and mixed with
men of all conditions. In this way they adopted
ideas from many sources, although always professing
to base their teaching on the Koran and
Tradition.</p>

<p>According to Nicholson, the Mystics of Islam borrowed
not only from Christianity and Neoplatonism,
but from Gnosticism and Buddhism. Many
Gospel texts and sayings of Jesus, most of them
apocryphal, are cited in the oldest Sufi writings.
From Christianity they took the use of the woollen
dress, the vows of silence, the litanies (<i>Zikr</i>), and
other ascetic practices. Their teaching also has
many interesting parallels which Nicholson summarizes
as follows: “The same expressions are
applied to the founder of Islam which are used by
St. John, St. Paul, and later mystical theologians
concerning Christ. Thus, Mohammed is called the
Light of God, he is said to have existed before the
creation of the world, he is adored as the source of
all life, actual and possible, he is the Perfect Man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
in whom all the divine attributes are manifested,
and a Sufi tradition ascribes to him the saying,
‘He that hath seen me hath seen Allah.’ In the
Moslem scheme, however, the Logos doctrine occupies
a subordinate place, as it obviously must
when the whole duty of man is believed to consist
in realizing the unity of God.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Neoplatonism gave them the doctrine of emanation
and ecstasy. The following version of the
doctrine of the seventy thousand veils, as expounded
to Canon Gairdner by a modern dervish,
shows clear traces of Gnosticism. “Seventy
Thousand Veils separate Allah, the One reality,
from the world of matter and of sense. And every
soul passes before his birth through these seventy
thousand. The inner half of these are veils of
light: the outer half, veils of darkness. For every
one of the veils of light passed through, in this
journey towards birth, the soul puts off a divine
quality; and for every one of the dark veils, it
puts on an earthly quality. Thus the child is
born weeping, for the soul knows its separation
from Allah, the one Reality. And when the child
cries in its sleep, it is because the soul remembers
something of what it has lost. Otherwise, the
passage through the veils has brought with it forgetfulness
(<i>nisyan</i>): and for this reason man is
called <i>insan</i>. He is now, as it were, in prison in
his body, separated by these thick curtains from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
Allah. But the whole purpose of Sufism, the
Way of the dervish, is to give him an escape from
this prison, an apocalypse of the Seventy Thousand
Veils, a recovery of the original unity with
The One, while still in this body.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>In regard to Buddhist influence, Professor
Goldziher has called attention to the fact that in
the eleventh century the teaching of Buddha exerted
considerable influence in eastern Persia,
especially at Balkh, a city famous for the number
of Sufis who dwelt in it. From the Buddhists
came the use of the rosary (afterwards adopted by
Christians in Europe), and perhaps also the doctrine
of <i>fana</i> or absorption into God.</p>

<p>“While <i>fana</i>,” says Nicholson, “in its pantheistic
form is radically different from Nirvana, the
terms coincide so closely in other ways that we
cannot regard them as being altogether unconnected.
<i>Fana</i> has an ethical aspect: it involves the
extinction of all passions and desires. The passing
away of evil qualities and of the evil actions
which they produce is said to be brought about by
the continuance of the corresponding good qualities
and actions.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The cultivation of character
by the contemplation of God in a mystical sense
was the real goal. To know God was to be like
Him and to be like Him ended in absorption or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
ecstasy.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> One of their favourite sayings was that
attributed to God by the Prophet, “I was a hidden
treasure and I desired to be known, so I created the
creation in order that I might be known.” Just
as the universe is the mirror of God’s being, so the
heart of man is to the Sufi the mirror of the universe.
If he would know God or Truth he must
look into his own heart.</p>

<p>To quote Al-Ghazali himself: “The aim which
the Sufis set before them is as follows: To free the
soul from the tyrannical yoke of the passions, to
deliver it from its wrong inclinations and evil instincts,
in order that in the purified heart there
should only remain room for God and for the invocation
of His holy name.</p>

<p>“As it was more easy to learn their doctrine than
to practise it, I studied first of all those of their
books which contain it: <i>The Nourishment of
Hearts</i>, by Abu Talib of Mecca, the works of
Hareth el Muhasibi, and the fragments which still
remain, of Junaid, Shibli, Abu Yezid, Bustami and
other leaders (whose souls may God sanctify). I
acquired a thorough knowledge of their researches,
and I learned all that was possible to learn of their
methods by study and oral teaching. It became
clear that the last stage could not be reached by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
mere instruction, but only by transport, ecstasy,
and the transformation of the moral being” (p. 41,
“Confessions”).</p>

<p>“Among the teachings of the Sufis was that of
the preëxistence of Mohammed the Prophet in the
Essence of Light. According to the Traditions,
‘I was a prophet while Adam was yet between
earth and clay,’ and ‘There is no prophet after
me,’ Sufis hold that Mohammed was a prophet even
before the creation and that he still holds office.
This identification of Mohammed with the Primal
Element explains the names sometimes given him,
such as Universal Reason, the Great Spirit, the
Truth of Humanity, the Possessor of the Ray of
Light—the Nur-i-Muhammadi—from God’s own
splendour.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Absorption in God, therefore, or union with
Him is the goal of all the Sufi teachings and practices.
The entire negation of self clears the way
for the apprehension of the Truth. This journey
towards God has its stages which are generally
given as eight in number: service, love, abstraction,
knowledge, ecstasy, truth, union, extinction. Some
of the Sufis went so far as to set aside external
religion, and showed an utter indifference to the
ritual as well as to the moral law. Al-Ghazali was
not of their number. He teaches, however, that
the ordinary theologian cannot enter on the mystic
path, for he is still in bondage to dogma and wanders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
about in darkness. Prayer, fasting, pilgrimage
in all their requirements and the details of their
observations have, therefore, a twofold significance;
the outward and formal one which is understood
by the common people, and the spiritual, real,
esoteric significance which is only grasped by those
who give themselves entirely to God.</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali was thoroughly aware of the dangers
of Sufism both in its creed by way of becoming
pantheistic, and in its antinomian practices. He
saw that divorce between religion and morals would
be disastrous and must therefore have been shocked
by such verses as those of Omar Khayyam:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Khayyam! why weep you that your life is bad;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What boots it thus to mourn? Rather be glad.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He that sins not can make no claim to mercy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mercy was made for sinners—be not sad.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">His teaching regarding sin and repentance was, as
we shall see later, altogether more fundamental.</p>

<p>From the earliest times pantheistic Sufism found
a home in Khorasan among the Moslems. The old
idea of incarnation emerged when the Shiah sect
separated itself and paid such high veneration to
Ali. The sect of the Khattahiyah worshipped the
Imam Jafar Sadik as God. Others believed that
the divine spirit had descended upon Abdallah Ibn
Amr. In Khorasan the opinion was widely spread
that Abu Muslim, the great general who overturned
the dynasty of the Ommeyads and set up that of
the Abbassides, was an incarnation of the spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
God. In the same province under Al Mansur, the
second Abbasside Caliph, a religious leader named
Ostasys professed to be an emanation of the Godhead.
He collected thousands of followers, and
the movement was not suppressed without much
fighting. Under the Caliph Mahdi a self-styled
Avatar named Ata arose, who on account of a
golden mask which he continually wore was called
Mokanna, or “the veiled prophet.” He also had
a numerous following, and held the Caliph’s armies
in check for several years, till in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 779, being
closely invested in his castle, he, with his whole
harem and servants, put an end to themselves.</p>

<p>What Al-Ghazali himself thought of these speculations
of the Sufis and the danger of this kind of
mysticism we learn from his book: “The speculations
of the Sufis may be divided into two classes:
to the first category belong all the phases about
love to God and union with Him, which according
to them compensate for all outward works. Many
of them allege that they have attained to complete
oneness with God; that for them the veil has
been lifted; that they have not only seen the Most
High with their eyes, but have spoken with Him,
and so far as to say ‘The Most High spoke thus
and thus.’ They wish to imitate Hallaj, who was
crucified for using such expressions, and justify
themselves by quoting his saying, ‘I am the Truth.’
They also refer to Abu Yazid Bistami, who is reported
to have exclaimed, ‘Praise be to me!’ instead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
of ‘Praise be to God!’ This kind of speculation
is extremely dangerous for the common
people, and it is notorious that a number of craftsmen
have left their occupation to make similar
assertions. Such speeches are highly popular, as
they hold out to men the prospect of laying aside
active work with the idea of purging the soul
through mystical ecstasies and transports. The
common people are not slow to claim similar rights
for themselves and to catch up wild and whirling
expressions. As regards the second class of Sufi
speculation, it consists in the use of unintelligible
phrases which by their outward apparent meaning
and boldness attract attention, but which on closer
inspection prove to be devoid of any real sense.”</p>

<p>Not only did Al-Ghazali realize the danger on
the side of pantheism, but he was aware that such
religious enthusiasm often led to gross hypocrisy.
In his <i>Ihya</i> he mentions “that the prophet commanded
that whoever did not feel moved to tears
at the recitation of the Koran should pretend to
weep and to be deeply moved”; for, adds Al-Ghazali
sagely, “in these matters one begins by
forcing oneself to do what afterwards comes
spontaneously.” Moreover, the fact that religious
excitement was looked upon as the mark of a
fervent mind and devout intensity, vastly increased
the number of those who claimed mystic illumination.
He divides the ecstatic conditions which the
hearing of poetical recitations produces into four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
classes. The first, which is the lowest, is that of
the simple sensuous delight in melody. The second
class is that of pleasure in the melody and of
understanding the words in their apparent sense.
The third class consists of those who apply the
meaning of the words to the relations between man
and God. To this class belongs the would-be initiate
into Sufism. He goes on to say, “He has
necessarily a goal marked out for him to aim at,
and this goal is the knowledge of God, meeting
Him and union with Him by the way of secret
contemplation, and the removal of the veil which
conceals Him. In order to compass this aim the
Sufi has a special path to follow; he must perform
various ascetic practices and overcome certain spiritual
obstacles in doing so. Now when, during the
recitation of poetry, the Sufi hears mention made
of blame or praise, of acceptance or refusal, of
union with the Beloved or separation from Him,
of lament over a departed joy or longing for a
look, as often occurs in Arabic poetry, one or the
other of these accords with his spiritual state and
acts upon him like a spark on tinder, to set his
heart aflame. Longing and love overpower him
and unfold to him manifold vistas of spiritual experience.</p>

<p>“The fourth and highest class is that of the
fully initiated who have passed through the stages
above mentioned, and whose minds are closed to
everything except God. Such an one is wholly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
denuded of self, so that he no longer knows his
own experiences and practices, and, as though with
senses sealed, sinks into the ocean of the contemplation
of God. This condition the Sufis characterize
as self-annihilation (<i>Fana</i>).” (“The Confessions.”)</p>

<p>Elsewhere he compares this highest condition of
ecstasy of the human soul to a clear mirror—of
course he means the mirror of the ancients made
of polished brass or bronze—which reflects the
colours of anything towards which it is directed.
Again and again he comes back to this metaphor
in his books. Sin is like rust on the mirror of the
soul. Light is reflected in it, but the rays are no
longer clear, until by repentance the rust of guilt
and passion are removed.</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali’s mysticism was always accompanied
by orthodox insistence on the six articles of faith
and the five pillars of practice, through which alone
the soul can receive its fundamental impulse towards
God.</p>

<p>Yet Al-Ghazali’s mysticism leads him to emphasize
always the spiritual side of worship. The
mere form is nothing in itself. The author of the
Masnavi had mastered Al-Ghazali and absorbed his
spirit when he wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fools laud and magnify the mosque,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While they strive to oppress holy men of heart.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the former is mere form, the latter spirit and truth.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The only true mosque is that in the hearts of saints.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mosque that is built in the heart of the saints</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is the place of worship of all, for God dwells there.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">What he says on the imitation of God is based almost
literally on Al-Ghazali’s book describing
God’s attributes.</p>

<p>Abu Saʾid bin Abu ’l-Khair, also of Khorasan
(<span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 396-440), was one of Al-Ghazali’s teachers
in the school of mysticism. When he was asked
what a Sufi was he said: “Whatever is in thy head,
forget it; whatever is in thy hand, give it away;
and whatever happens to thee, disregard it.”</p>

<p>In regard to the rise of Sufic teaching, its origin
and character, Dr. C. Snouck Hurgronje remarks:
“The lamp which Allah had caused Mohammed
to hold up to guide mankind with its light,
was raised higher and higher after the Prophet’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
death, in order to shed its light over an ever increasing
part of humanity. This was not possible,
however, without its reservoir being replenished
with all the different kinds of oil that had from
time immemorial given light to those different
nations. The oil of mysticism came from Christian
circles, and its Neoplatonic origin was quite
unmistakable; Persia and India also contributed to
it. There were those who, by asceticism, by different
methods of mortifying the flesh, liberated
the spirit that it might rise and become united with
the origin of all being; to such an extent that with
some the profession of faith was reduced to the
blasphemous exclamation: ‘I am Allah.’”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus8.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Facsimile title page of the last book Ghazali wrote, entitled
“Minhaj Al-ʾAbidin.” On the margin this Cairo edition gives
another of his celebrated works, “Badayat-al-Hadaya.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But he goes on to say that although many went
to such extremes and in their pantheistic ideas lost
sight of the moral law and the restriction of conduct
it was Al-Ghazali who rescued Islam to a
large degree from this danger. He recommended
moral perfection of the soul by asceticism as the
only way through which men could approach nearer
to God. “His mysticism wished to avoid the
danger of pantheism, to which so many others were
led by their contemplations, and which so often
engendered disregard of the revealed law, or even
of morality.”</p>

<p>It is therefore from the days of Al-Ghazali that
ethical mysticism obtained its birthright in the
world of Islam together with law and dogma.
These now form the sacred trio of religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
sciences, and are taught in every great centre of
Moslem learning. For dogma other writers are
more authoritative. For Moslem law there is the
study of the great writers of the four Schools, but
in matters of ethics Al-Ghazali still holds his own.</p>

<p>To quote once more from Hurgronje: “The
ethical mysticism of Al-Ghazali is generally recognized
as orthodox; and the possibility of attaining
to a higher spiritual sphere by means of methodic
asceticism and contemplation is doubted by few.
The following opinion has come to prevail in wide
circles: the Law offers the bread of life to all the
faithful, the dogmatics are the arsenal from which
the weapons must be taken to defend the treasures
of religion against unbelief and heresy, but mysticism
shows the earthly pilgrim the way to
Heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>In one particular, however, this ethical teaching
is utterly disappointing. Al-Ghazali’s mysticism is
not for the multitude. It is esoteric, for a particular
class who are filled with religious pride that
they, in this respect, are not as other men. Even
the noblest minds in Islam restrict true religious
life to an aristocratic minority, and, like the Pharisees
of old, consider the ignorance of the multitude
an evil that cannot be remedied. The teaching
of Al-Ghazali was intended not for the masses
but for the initiates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>It is remarkable that while he founded a cloister
for Sufis at Tus and taught and governed there
himself during the closing years of his life, he left
no established order behind him. Professor Macdonald
thinks that in his time the movement towards
continuous corporations and brotherhoods
had not yet begun. But this is a mistake, for in
the <i>Kashf-al-Mahjub</i> (<span class="allsmcap">A. H. 456</span>) we already find
a list of the various schools of Dervishes and their
peculiar methods of devotion. Al-Ghazali’s <i>teaching</i>,
however, is popular among all the Dervish
orders of to-day.</p>

<p>A special study has been made of one of Al-Ghazali’s
esoteric works on mysticism entitled
<i>Mishkat al-Anwar</i>, by Canon W. H. T. Gairdner,
in which he answers the critics of this work, and
shows conclusively that whatever may have been
Al-Ghazali’s method he was sincere. We borrow
from this interesting and scholarly paper two
paragraphs to illustrate the method of Al-Ghazali:</p>

<p>“In expounding the tradition of the Seventy
Thousand Veils with which Allah had veiled Himself
from the vision of man, Ghazali finds opportunity
to graduate various religions and sects according
as they are more, or less, thickly veiled
from the light; <i>i. e.</i>, according as they more or less
nearly approximate to Absolute Truth (al-Haqq—the
Real—Allah). The veils which veil the various
religions and sects from the Divine Light are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
conceived of as twofold in character, light veils and
dark veils, and the principle of graduation is according
as the followers of these religions and
sects are veiled (<i>a</i>) by dark veils, (<i>b</i>) by dark and
light mixed, or (<i>c</i>) by light veils only. The recital
closes with a short passage which tells us that
the Attainers (<i>al-wasilun</i>) have had the Sufi doctrine
of <i>kashf</i> in its most explicit and striking
form.</p>

<p>“(<i>a</i>) Those veiled by pure darkness, called here
the <i>mulhida</i>, are those who deny the existence of
Allah and of a Last Day. They have two main
divisions, those who have inquired for a cause to
account for the world and have made Nature that
cause; and those who have made no such inquiry.
The former are clearly the Naturists or <i>dahriya</i>
who were the very abomination of desolation to
Ghazali. It is curious that nothing further is said
of their evil conduct, and it is entirely characteristic
of mediæval thought that the deepest damnation is
thus reserved for false opinion, rather than for
evil life. Evil doers form the second division
(which, however, is not definitely said to be
higher than the first), composed of those who are
too greedy and selfish so much as to look for a
cause, or in fact to think of anything except their
vile selves. These we might style the Egotists;
they are ranged in ascending order into (1) seekers
of sensual pleasure, (2) seekers of dominion,
(3) money-grubbers, (4) lovers of vain-glory.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
In the first he has the ordinary sensual herd in
view, as well as the philosophers of sensualism;
their veils are the veils of the bestial attributes,
while those of the second are the ferocious ones
(sabaʾiya). The denotation of the latter class is
quaintly given as Arabs, some Kurds and very
numerous Fools. The third and fourth subdivisions
do not call for comment.</p>

<p>“Mounting from these regions of unmitigated
darkness we come to (<i>b</i>), those veiled by light
and darkness mixed. Ghazali’s idea of the dark
veils in general may be gathered from a comparison
of this and the previous section. In this
section the dark veils are shown to be the false
conceptions of deity, which the human mind is
deluded into making by the gross and limited elements
in its own constitution, namely (in ascending
order) by the Senses, the Phantasy or Imagination
and the Discursive Reason. The dark veils
of the previous section were the unmitigated egotism
and materialism which employed these faculties
for self and the world alone, without a thought
of deity. The light veils, accordingly, are the true
but partial intuitions whereby man rises to the idea
of deity, or to a something at least higher than
himself. These intuitions are no more than partial,
because they fix upon some one aspect or attribute
of deity,—majesty, beauty, and so forth,—and believing
it to be all in all proceed to deify all majestic,
beautiful, etc., things. Thus they half reveal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
half conceal, Allah, and so are literally veils
of light.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Does not this remind us of St. Paul’s words:
“Now we see through (in) a glass darkly but then
face to face, etc.”? Did Al-Ghazali borrow from
the Gospel here also?</p>

<p>It has been pointed out by Margoliouth and
others that Mohammedan Sufism is largely based
on Christian teaching. This is especially true in
the case of Abu Talib, Al-Ghazali’s favourite
writer on this subject. “Sometimes the matter
is taken over bodily; thus the Parable of the Sower
is told by the earliest Sufi writer. Abu Talib takes
over the dialogue in the Gospel eschatology between
the Saviour and those who are taunted with
having seen Him hungry and refused Him food;
only for the questioner he substitutes Allah, and
for ‘the least of these’ his Moslem brother. Not
a few of the Beatitudes are taken over sometimes
with the name of their author. Commonplaces
which are found in Christian homiletic works reappear
with little or no alteration in the Sufi sermons.
In the Acts of Thomas, the Apostle, when
employed by a king to build a palace, spends the
money in charity to the poor. Presently the king’s
brother dies, and finds that a wonderful palace has
been built for the king in Paradise with the Alms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
which Thomas bestowed in his name. This story
reappears in the doctrine of Abu Talib that when
a poor man takes charity from the wealthy, he is
thereby building him a house in Paradise.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Not only in Qut-ul-Qulub, the famous book of
Abu Talib, but in all Al-Ghazali’s works we have
numerous quotations and references to the Gospels
apocryphal or genuine, as we shall see later.</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali prescribed forms for morning and
evening prayer which do not differ greatly from the
prayers recommended in Christian manuals of devotion.
His teaching on prayer is an effort to
spiritualize the ceremony, and in this he follows the
teaching of the older Sufis. Absorption in God
during prayer was their ideal. To avoid distraction
men were advised to pray towards a blank
wall, lest any architectural ornament might distract
their attention. Others boasted that they
could attain to absorption under any circumstances.
“There were saints who when they started their
<i>salat</i> told their women-folk that they might chatter
as much as they liked and even beat drums; they
were too much absorbed in prayer to hear, however
loud the noise. When one of them was saying
his <i>salat</i> in the Mosque of Basrah a column
fell, bringing down with it an erection of four
storeys; he continued praying, and when after he
had finished the people congratulated him on his
escape, he asked, what from? Great names were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
quoted for the practice of praying hastily, and
so shortening the time taken by the devotion as
to give Satan no chance of distracting the
thoughts.”</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali, however, believed in reverence and
emphasized outward and inward preparation for
this act of devotion. “Prayer,” says he, “is a
nearness to God and a gift which we present to the
King of kings even as one who comes from a distant
village brings it before the ruler. And your
gift is accepted of God and will be returned to
you on the great day of judgment, so that you are
responsible to present it as beautiful as possible.”
He quotes with approval a saying of Mohammed:
“True prayer is to make one’s self meek and
humble,” and adds that the presence of the heart
is the soul of true prayer and that absent-mindedness
destroys all its value.</p>

<p>“True prayer,” he continues, “consists of six
things: the presence of the heart, understanding,
magnifying God, fear, hope, and a sense of shame.”
He then treats successively these elements of true
prayer, showing in what they consist, how they are
occasioned and how they may be secured. We
secure the presence of our hearts by a deep sense of
the eternal. What he says in regard to God’s
greatness may well be compared with such passages
as the eighth Psalm, “What is man that Thou art
mindful of him?” Our sense of shame is quickened,
he says, by remembering our shortcomings in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
worship. The only way we can secure the presence
of the heart in prayer is by drawing our thoughts
away from outward diversions and from those
within. We should not pray in the public streets,
for there our mind is diverted. If we can pray
towards a dead wall on which there is nothing to
see it will be helpful. But the inward withdrawal
of the heart is still more important.</p>

<p>What he says about the true <i>kibla</i> is also worth
quoting. “It is the turning away of your outward
gaze from everything save the direction of
the holy house of God. Do you not then think
that the turning aside of your heart from all other
things to the consideration of God Most High is
required of you? It certainly is. Nothing else is
required of you in prayer than this, so that I would
say the face of your heart must turn with the face
of your body; and even as no one is able to face
the house of God save by turning away from every
other direction, so the heart does not truly turn
towards God save by being separated from everything
else than himself.”</p>

<p>“When you stand up to pray,” he says, “remember
the day when you must stand before God’s
throne and be judged. Be clear of hypocrisy in
prayer. Do not follow those who profess to worship
the face of God and at the same time seek the
praise of men.... Flee from the devil, for
he is as a devouring lion. How can any one who
is pursued by a lion or an enemy who would devour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
him or kill him say, ‘I take refuge with God from
them in this castle or in this fort,’ and still linger
without entering the fort? Surely this will not
profit him. The only way to secure protection is
to change his place. In like manner whoever follows
his lusts, which are the lurking place of Satan
and the abomination of the Merciful, the mere saying,
‘I take refuge in God’ will not profit. Whosoever
takes his passions for a God he is under the
reign of the devil and not in the safe keeping of
his Lord.”</p>

<p>He gives a long spiritual interpretation of the
<i>fatihah</i> which is beautiful. “At the conclusion of
your formal prayer,” he says, “offer your humble
petitions and thanksgivings and expect an answer
and join in your petition your parents and the rest
of true believers. And when you give the final
<i>salaams</i> remember the two angels who sit on your
shoulders.”</p>

<p>In the giving of alms he says seven things are
required: promptness, secrecy, example—(and in
this connection he quotes a Tradition ascribed <i>to
the Prophet</i> about the left hand not knowing what
the right hand doeth)—absence of boasting or
pride, the gift must not be spoken of as great, our
best is demanded, for God is supremely good and
He will only take the best, and we must give our
alms to the right persons. Of these he mentions
six classes: the pious, the learned, the righteous,
the deserving poor, those in need because of sickness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
or family distress, <i>and relatives</i>. With him,
charity <i>ends</i> at home.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp37" id="illus9" style="max-width: 21.875em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A Mihrab or prayer-niche made of cedar wood and dating
from the Eleventh Century. (Cairo Museum.)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is clear, however, from Al-Ghazali’s teaching
that only Moslems are intended in his classification
of those who may receive the <i>Zakat</i>. There is no
universal brotherhood in Islam. Jews and Christians
are outside the pale, save as they have “the
rights of neighbours.”</p>

<p>Christians might well regard Al-Ghazali’s mystical
method of reading the Koran in their perusal
of the Scriptures. He tells us we must regard
eight things: the greatness of the revelation; the
majesty of the Speaker; the need of a prepared
heart; meditation; understanding the content of
the passage, not twisting its meaning; we are to
make the application to ourselves; and finally we
must read it so that its effect may show in our
lives. By the word Koran, he says, “we mean not
the reading but the following of the teaching, for
the movement of the tongue in pronouncing the
words is of little value. The true reading is when
the tongue and the mind and the heart are associated.
The part of the tongue is to pronounce the
words clearly in chanting. The part of the mind
is to interpret the meaning. The part of the heart
is to translate it into life. So that the tongue
chants and the mind interprets and the heart is a
preacher and a warner.”</p>

<p>The greatest chapter of his <i>opus magnum</i> is undoubtedly
that on Repentance. It may well be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
compared with the fifty-first Psalm or the seventh
chapter of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans. That
Al-Ghazali himself had a deep sense of sin, no one
can doubt. He was not a Pharisee but an earnest
seeker after God. He teaches clearly that all the
prophets, including Mohammed, were sinners, although
he nowhere mentions any sinfulness in
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>One of the most important passages is that in
which he speaks of the benefit of asking pardon.
It reads as follows: “Said Mohammed the Prophet
(upon him be peace): ‘Verily, I ask forgiveness
of God and repent towards Him every day seventy
times.’” He said this, so says Al-Ghazali, although
God had already testified, “We have forgiven
thee, thy former and thy latter sins.” “Said
the Prophet of God, ‘Truly a faintness comes over
my heart until I ask God forgiveness every day
one hundred times.’ And said the Prophet (on
him be peace), ‘Whosoever says when he goes to
sleep, “I ask forgiveness of the Great God, than
whom there is no other, the living, and I repent of
my sins three times,” God will forgive him his
sins even though they were as the foam of the seas
or its sands piled up, or as the numbers of the
leaves on the trees or the days of the world.’ And
said the Prophet of God (upon him be peace),
‘Whosoever says that word I will forgive his sins
though he deserts the army.’” Al-Ghazali relates
a story of one Hudhifa, who said, “I was accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
to speak sharply to my wife, and I said, ‘O,
Apostle of God, I am afraid lest my tongue should
cause me to enter the fire,’ and then the Prophet of
God (upon whom be peace) said, ‘Where art thou
in asking for forgiveness compared with me, for
I ask forgiveness of God every day one hundred
times.’ And ʾAyesha said (may God give her His
favour), concerning the Prophet, ‘He said to me,
“If you have committed a sin ask forgiveness of
God and repent to Him, for true repentance for a sin
is turning away from it and asking forgiveness.”’
And the Apostle of God (upon whom be peace)
was accustomed to say when he asked for forgiveness:
‘O God, forgive my sin and my ignorance
and my excess in what I have done, and what Thou
knowest better than I do. O God, forgive me my
trifling and my earnestness, my mistakes and my
wrong intentions and all that I have done. O God,
forgive me that which I have committed in the past
and that which I will commit in the future, and
what I have hidden and what I have revealed and
what Thou knowest better than I do, Thou who art
the first and the last and Thou art the Almighty.’”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
How different all this is from the present day
superficial teaching about the sinlessness of Mohammed
which is current in popular Islam.</p>

<p>Since Al-Ghazali tells this about Mohammed and
<i>his</i> need for forgiveness, he naturally deals with
repentance in no superficial fashion but as one who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
has tasted the bitterness of remorse and has discovered
his own inability to meet the demands of
the Moral Law. His book on repentance has the
following sections: (1) The reality of repentance.
(2) The necessity for repentance. (3) True repentance
expected by God. (4) Of what a man
should repent, namely, the character of sin.
(5) How small sins become great. (6) Perfect repentance,
its conditions and its duration. (7) The
degree of repentance. (8) How to become truly
penitent.</p>

<p>One can only give a summary of his teaching.
He rises far above the Koran. In fact in some
cases his proof texts, when we consider the context,
are a terrible indictment of the Prophet.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>He says the necessity of repentance always and
for all men is evident because no one of the human
race is free from sin. “For even though in some
cases he is free from outward sin of his bodily
members, he is not free from sin of the heart;
though free from passion he is not free from the
whisperings of Satan and forgetfulness of God, or
of coming short of the knowledge of God and His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
attributes and His works.” All this is a failure of
attainment and has its reasons; but if a man should
forsake the causes of this forgetfulness and employ
himself with the opposite virtues it would be a return
to the right way; and the significance of repentance
is the return. You cannot imagine that
any one of us is free from this defect, for we only
differ in degrees, but the root undoubtedly exists
in us. Of course he ignores original sin, being a
Moslem, but he makes a great deal of the effect that
unrepented sin causes; but it enters deeper and
deeper into the heart until the image of God on the
mirror of the human soul is effaced.</p>

<p>Another illustration he uses is that of the heart
as a goodly garment which has been dragged
through filth and needs to be washed again with
soap and water. “Using the heart in the exercise
of our passions makes it filthy. We must therefore
wash it in the water of tears and by the
rubbing of repentance. It is for you to rub it
clean and then God will accept it.” How near and
yet how far from the teaching of David and Isaiah
and St. Paul! Did Al-Ghazali ever hear some
pious Jew quote Isaiah’s statement that “all our
righteousnesses are as filthy rags”?</p>

<p>True repentance has a twofold result according
to this Moslem theologian. Although he does not
touch the deeper problem of how God can be just
and justify the sinner, he teaches that the result
of the forgiveness of our sins is that “we stand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
before God as though we had none,” and that “we
attain a higher degree of righteousness.” The
cross of Christ is the missing link in Al-Ghazali’s
creed. He comes very close to Christianity and
yet always misses the heart of its teaching. He is
groping towards the light but does not grasp the
hand of a friend or find a Redeemer. It is all a
righteousness by works and an attainment of the
knowledge of God by meditation without justification
through an atonement.</p>

<p>Yet Al-Ghazali’s teaching on “the Practice of
the Presence of God” is very much like that of
Brother Lawrence in his celebrated Essay. In his
“Beginner’s Guide to Religion and Morals” (Al
Badayet) he writes: “Know, therefore, that your
companion who never deserts you at home or
abroad, when you are asleep or when you are
awake, whether you are dead or alive, is your Lord
and Master, your Creator and Preserver, and whensoever
you remember Him He is sitting beside you.
For God Himself hath said, ‘I am the close companion
of those who remember me.’ And whenever
your heart is contrite with sorrow because of
your neglect of religion He is your companion who
keeps close to you, for God hath said, ‘I am with
those who are broken-hearted on my account.’
And if you only knew Him as you ought to know
Him you would take Him as a companion and
forsake all men for His sake. But as you are
unable to do this at all times, I warn you that you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
set aside a certain time by night and by day for
communion with your Creator that you may delight
yourself in Him and that He may deliver you
from evil.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> At times, especially when he speaks
of the <i>veils</i> that hide reality and God, we are reminded
of the lines of Whitehead on “the Second
Day of Creation”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I gaze aloof at the tissued roof</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where time and space are the warp and woof,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Which the King of Kings, like a curtain flings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">O’er the dreadfulness of eternal things.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if I could see, as in truth they be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The glories that encircle me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I should lightly hold this tissued fold</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With its marvellous curtain of blue and gold;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For soon the whole, like a parched scroll,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall before my amazèd eyes unroll,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And without a screen at one burst be seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The Presence in which I have always been.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Al-Ghazali did not know God’s nearness
through the Incarnation of Christ. The hoped-for
Vision of God was always full of fear and dread
of judgment. The <i>fear</i> of God was the beginning
and end of wisdom. What he understood by the
fear of God is clear from the following passage
taken from the “Revival of Religious Sciences”:
“By the fear of God I do not mean a fear like
that of women when their eyes swim and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
hearts beat at hearing some eloquent religious discourse,
which they quickly forget and turn again
to frivolity. That is no real fear at all. He who
fears a thing flees from it, and he who hopes for a
thing strives for it, and the only fear that will save
thee is that fear that forbids sinning against God
and instils obedience to Him. Beware of the
shallow fear of women and fools, who, when they
hear of the terrors of the Lord, say lightly, ‘We
take refuge in God,’ and at the same time continue
in the very sins which will destroy them. Satan
laughs at such pious ejaculations. They are like a
man who should meet a lion in a desert, while there
is a fortress at no great distance away, and when
he sees the ravenous beast, should stand exclaiming,
‘I take refuge in God.’ God will not protect
thee from the terrors of His judgment unless thou
really take refuge in Him.”</p>

<p>Included with his fear of God there was always
a fear of death which can best be described as
mediæval or early Moslem. Towards the close of
his life he composed a short work on eschatology
called “The Precious Pearl.” It is no less lurid
in its terrible pictures of death and the judgment
than some of his older works. In it he says:
“When you watch a dead man and see that the
saliva has run from his mouth, that his lips are
contracted, his face black, the whites of his eyes
showing, know that he is damned, and that the
fact of his damnation in the other world has just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
been revealed to him. But if you see the dead with
a smile on his lips, a serene countenance, his eyes
half-closed, know that he has just received the
good news of the happiness which awaits him in
the other world....</p>

<p>“On the day of Judgment, when all men are gathered
before the throne of God, their accounts are
all cast up, and their good and evil deeds weighed.
During all this time each man believes he is the
only one with whom God is dealing. Though
peradventure at the same moment God is taking
account of countless multitudes whose number is
known to Him only. Men do not see each other
or hear each other speak.”</p>

<p>In summing up the character of the Mystic
Claud Field says: “As St. Augustine found deliverance
from doubt and error in his inward experience
of God, and Descartes in self-consciousness,
so Ghazali, unsatisfied with speculation and
troubled by scepticism, surrenders himself to the
will of God. Leaving others to demonstrate the
existence of God from the external world, he finds
God revealed in the depths of his own consciousness
and the mystery of his own free will....
He is a unique and lonely figure in Islam, and has
to this day been only partially understood. In the
Middle Ages his fame was eclipsed by that of
Averroes, whose commentary on Aristotle is alluded
to by Dante, and was studied by Thomas
Aquinas and the schoolman. Averroes’ system<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
was rounded and complete, but Ghazali was one
of those ‘whose reach exceeds their grasp’; he
was always striking after something he had not attained,
and stands in many respects nearer to modern
mind than Averroes. Renan, though far from
sympathizing with his religious earnestness, calls
him ‘the most original mind among Arabian
philosophers.’”</p>

<p>The disciple of Al-Ghazali is perhaps of all Moslems
the nearest to the Gospel, and we may hope
that when his works are carefully studied and compared
with the teaching of Christianity many may
find in him a schoolmaster to lead them to Christ.
Educated Moslems of to-day may well heed the
warning with which Al-Ghazali closes his “Confessions”:
“The knowledge of which we speak is
not derived from sources accessible to human diligence,
and that is why progress in mere worldly
knowledge renders the sinner more hardened in his
revolt against God. True knowledge, on the contrary,
inspires in him who is initiated in it more
fear and more reverence, and raises a barrier of
defense between him and sin. He may slip and
stumble, it is true, as is inevitable with one encompassed
by human infirmity, but these slips and
stumbles will not weaken his faith. The true Moslem
succumbs occasionally to temptation but he
repents and will not persevere obstinately in the
path of error. I pray God the Omnipotent to place
us in the ranks of His chosen, among the number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
of those whom He directs in the path of safety, in
whom He inspires fervour lest they forget Him;
whom He cleanses from all defilement, that nothing
may remain in them except Himself; yea of those
whom He indwells completely, that they may adore
none beside Him.”</p>

<p>Being a Moslem, Al-Ghazali was either too
proud to search for the true historical facts of the
Christian religion, or perhaps it would be more
charitable to say that he had no adequate opportunity,
in spite of his quotations and misquotations
from the “Gospels.” Otherwise he could have found
there what would have met his heart-hunger and
satisfied his soul—the manifestation of God not in
some intangible principle, but in a living person, in
Jesus Christ, who “is the image of the invisible
God, the first born of every creature. For by Him
were all things created that are in heaven, and that
are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers;
in Him are all things, and by Him all things consist.”
(Colossians 1: 15-17.) Those who dwell
in Christ and in whom He dwells are a part of
His spiritual body. They are the branches of the
living Vine. They are one in life and purpose, although
they remain conscious evermore of their
own individual existence; they are fitted progressively
for a deeper communion with God. To such
a conception the Sufi never attained. Al-Ghazali
admits that no man has seen God at any time, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
he failed to realize that “the Only Begotten, Who
is in the bosom of the Father, hath declared Him.”
The artificial glory of Mohammed in his case, as
for centuries afterwards, hid the light of the knowledge
of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
Yet not altogether, as the next chapter will make
clear.</p>

<h3>IX<br>
JESUS CHRIST IN AL-GHAZALI</h3>

<p>Jesus Christ is the Touch-Stone of character,
the Master of all spiritual leaders and
the one supreme and infallible Judge who can
pronounce an unerring verdict concerning the
truth of any religious system or teaching. What
place has Jesus in the teaching of the greatest of
all Moslem theologians, what place had He in the
heart of this great mystic, this seeker after God,
who, whatever else he may have been, was utterly
sincere in his search? Al-Ghazali, as a student of
the Koran, must have noticed that in this book
Christ occupies a high place; no fewer than three
of the chapters of the Koran, namely, that of
Amram’s Family (Surah III), that of The Table
(Surah V), and that of Mary (Surah XIX), derive
their names from references to Jesus Christ
and His work. The very fact that Jesus Christ
has a place in the literature of Islam, and is
acknowledged by all Moslems as one of their
greater prophets in itself therefore challenges comparison
between Him and Mohammed. Did Al-Ghazali<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
ever meet this challenge and in how far
did he compare Mohammed with Christ? It is our
purpose in this chapter to answer the question by
collating all the important references in the <i>Ihya</i>
and his other works and then to draw some conclusions
both as to his sources and his opinions.
The reader may judge for himself how far Al-Ghazali
is a schoolmaster to lead Moslems to
Christ.</p>

<p>We search in vain among all his works for a
sketch of the life of Christ or of His teaching.
Al-Ghazali doubtless had read and was probably
well acquainted with the only popular work known
which gives a connected account of the life of
Jesus Christ according to Moslem sources, namely,
<i>Kitab qusus al Anbiya</i> by <i>Ibn Ibrahim Ath-Thaʾlabi</i>,
a doctor of theology of the Shafi School,
who died in <span class="allsmcap">A. H.</span> 427 (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1036). The fabulous
character of this mass of traditions has been shown
in a translation of the section which deals with
Jesus Christ.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Al-Ghazali does not give altogether
the same stories as are given by Ath-Thaʾlabi but
gives a great number of other incidents and reported
sayings, many of which resemble those
found in the Gospels and others which are wholly
apocryphal.</p>

<p>The question again arises where did Al-Ghazali
gain this knowledge of the Gospel? Did he have
access to a Persian or Arabic translation; or was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
all this material which we have collated, the result
of hearsay, gathered from the lips of Christian
monks and Jewish rabbis? It is perfectly clear that
he was acquainted with Old Testament tradition
even more than with that of the New Testament.
There are scores of passages in which he refers to
the teachings of Moses, the Psalms of David, and
the lives of the Old Testament Prophets. We have
already referred to translations of the Bible into
Arabic before the time of Al-Ghazali in our first
chapter. There is a tradition that “the People of
the Book used to read the Torah in Hebrew and interpret
it in Arabic to the followers of Islam.”
Another tradition says that “Kaʾab the Rabbi
brought a book to Omar the Caliph and said, ‘Here
is the Torah, read it.’”<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> We learn from the Jewish
Encyclopædia that “The <i>fihrist</i> of al-Nadim
mentions an Ahmed ibn Abd Allah ibn Salam who
translated the Bible into Arabic, at the time of
Haroun ar-Rashîd, and that <i>Fahr ud-Din ar-Razi</i>
mentions a translation of Habbakuk by the son of
<i>Rabban At-Tabari</i>. Many of the Arabic Historians
as At-Tabari, Masʾudi, Hamza, and Biruni
cite passages and recount the early history of the
Jews in a most circumstantial manner. Ibn Kutaibah,
the historian (d. 889), says that he read
the Bible; and he even made a collection of Biblical
passages in a work which has been preserved by
Ibn Jauzi of the twelfth century.” The first important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
Arabic translation is that of Saʾadia Gaon
(892-942). The influence of this translation was
in its way as great as that of Gaon’s philosophical
work.</p>

<p>A version of the Psalms was made by Hafiz al-Quti
in the tenth century and from internal evidence
we know that the author had been Christian.
Another translation of the Old Testament in Arabic
was made by the Jews in Cairo in the middle of
the eleventh century. The translation of Saʾadia
had become a standard work in Egypt, Palestine
and Syria, by the end of the tenth century, and it
was revised about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1070.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> As regards Persian
translations of the Bible we learn from the Jewish
Encyclopædia that according to Maimonides, the
Pentateuch was translated into Persian many hundred
years previous to Mohammed. But this
statement cannot be further substantiated. In regard
to Arabic versions of the Gospels we have
already given Dr. Kilgour’s statement.</p>

<p>Is it not probable that one or other of these
versions of the Gospel was known to Al-Ghazali?
Does he not himself state: “I have <i>read</i> in the
Gospel”? Not only does he reproduce the stories
and sayings of Christ from the Gospels but in some
cases, as the reader will see, the very words of the
text. It is true that there is much apocryphal
matter also of which the canonical Gospels know
nothing. We are in ignorance and we must remain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
in ignorance whence Al-Ghazali derived this
material; or did he invent it even as the men of
his day invented stories about Mohammed?</p>

<p>In the <i>Ihya</i> we find the following incidents, real
and apocryphal, regarding the life of Christ on
earth as a prophet and saint.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> We begin with Al-Ghazali’s
witness to His sinlessness: “It is said
that the devil (may God curse him) appeared to
Jesus and said, ‘Say there is no God but God.’
He replied: ‘The word is true but I will not repeat
it after you.’” (Vol. III, p. 23.) Again: “It is
related that when Jesus was born, the devils came
to Satan and said: ‘All the idols have fallen on
their faces.’ He said: ‘This has happened on your
account.’ Then he flew until he reached the
regions of the earth; there he found Jesus had
been born and the angels were protecting him.
So he returned to the devils and said to them:
‘Truly a Prophet was born yesterday. No
woman has ever given birth before to a child when
I was not present except in this case.’ And that
is why men now despair of worshipping idols.”
(Vol. III, p. 26.)</p>

<p>“It is related that Jesus one day was pillowing
his head on a stone; and the devil passed by and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
said: ‘O Jesus, now you have shown your love for
the world!’ Then Jesus picked up the stone,
threw it at him and said: ‘Take it and the world.’”
(Vol. III, p. 26.) We find this reference to the
days of His youth in Nazareth: “Some one said
to Jesus: ‘Who gave you your education?’ He
replied: ‘No one. But I beheld the ignorance of
the foolish despicable and so I departed from it.’”
“Jesus the Prophet was of those who were especially
favoured. Among the proofs of it is this
that he called down peace upon himself, for he
said: ‘Peace be on me the day I was born and the
day I shall die and the day I shall be raised up
alive.’ And this was because of his peace of mind
and his loving kindness towards men. But as for
John the son of Zachariah (on him be peace), he
took the place of awe and fear towards God and did
not utter these words until after they were repeated
to him by his Creator, who said: ‘Peace be
upon him the day he was born and the day he died
and the day he was raised again.’” This is an interesting
critical comment on the two passages referred
to, which occur in the same chapter of the
Koran, and I have never seen them used elsewhere
as an argument for the superiority of Christ to
John. (Vol. IV, p. 245.)</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali gives Jesus the usual titles given Him
in the Koran, namely, Son of Mary, Spirit of God,
Word of God, Prophet and Apostle. But these
latter titles mean little because he endorses the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
strange Moslem theory that there have been no
less than 124,000 prophets since the world began.
In his book “<i>Al-Iqtasad</i>” he devotes a long argument
to prove to the Jews that Jesus was indeed
a prophet, basing it upon his teaching and miracles
(pp. 83-86). In his <i>Jawahir ul-Koran</i> he even
classes Mary the Virgin with the prophets and
gives the list of these worthies in the following
curious order: Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses,
Aaron, Zachariah, John, Jesus, Mary, David, Solomon,
Joshua, Lot, Idris, Khudra, Shuʾaib, Elijah,
and Mohammed!</p>

<p>Regarding the fasting of our Lord, Al-Ghazali
says: “It is related that Jesus (on him be peace)
remained for sixty days without eating, engaged in
prayer; then he began to think of bread and behold
a loaf of bread appeared between his hands; then
he sat weeping because he had forgotten his
prayers. And behold an old man came to him
and Jesus said: ‘God bless you, O servant of God.
Call upon God Most High, for I too was in a sad
condition and I thought of bread until my prayer
departed.’ Then the old man prayed: ‘O God, if
thou knowest any occasion when the thought of
bread entered my head when I was praying do not
forgive me!’ Then he said to Jesus: ‘When
anything is brought to me to eat I eat it without
even thinking what it is.’” (Vol. III, p. 61.)
The following story seems to be based on the injunction
of the Gospel “to pluck out the eye” that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
offends: “It is related of Jesus (on him be peace)
that he once went out to pray for rain and when
the people gathered together Jesus said to them,
‘Whosoever of you hath committed a sin let him
turn back,’ so they all turned away and there was
no one left in the cave with him save one. And
Jesus said unto him, ‘Have you any sin?’ He
replied: ‘By God, I do not know of any except
that one day when I was praying a woman passed
by me and I looked upon her with this eye and
when she had passed I put my finger in my eye and
plucked it out and followed her to ask her pardon.’
Then Jesus said to him, ‘Call upon God that I may
believe in your sincerity.’ Then the man prayed
and the heavens were covered with clouds and the
rain poured down.” (Vol. II, p. 217.)</p>

<p>The following stories are related of the miracle-working
Christ: “Said the disciples to Jesus:
‘What do you think of the <i>dinar</i>-piece (money)?’
They said: ‘We think it is good.’ He said: ‘But
as for me I value it and ashes the same.’” (Vol.
III, p. 161.) “It was said to the Prophet that
Jesus (upon him be peace) used to walk upon the
water. He replied: ‘Had he still more striven
after holiness, he would have walked on the air.’”
(Vol. IV, p. 71.) “It is related that a certain
robber waylaid travellers among the children of
Israel for forty years. Jesus passed by that way
and behind him walked a saint of the worshippers
of the people of Israel, one of his disciples. Said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
the robber to himself: ‘This is the Prophet of
God who passes by and with him one of his disciples.
If I should come down I would be the
third.’” He then goes on to say that the robber
tried to show his humility by following not Christ
but his disciple. Jesus rebukes them both because
of their sins. (Vol. IV, p. 110.) “It is related
that Jesus (on him be peace) passed by a blind
man who was a leper and lame of both feet because
of paralysis and his flesh was consumed by leprosy,
and he was saying: ‘Praise be to God who has
kept me in good health and saved me from many
things which have befallen others of his creatures.’
Then Jesus said to him: ‘O thou friend, from what
kind of affliction do I see that you are free?’ and
he replied: ‘O Spirit of God, I am better than
those in whose heart God has not put anything of
his knowledge and his grace.’ And Jesus said:
‘You have spoken truly. Stretch forth your hand,’
and he stretched forth his hand and became of perfect
health both as to his body and his appearance,
for God had taken away all his sickness. So he
accompanied Jesus and worshipped with him.”
(Vol. IV, p. 250.)</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali often pictures the power of Jesus to
heal the sick, for Christ as the Merciful One appeals
to Moslems always and everywhere. We
have for example in the <i>Masnavi-i-Maʾanavi</i> this
beautiful picture which can be found in prose,
section by section in Al-Ghazali too.</p>

</div>

<p>Many of the miracles, however, are puerile, as
in this story: “A certain man accompanied Jesus
the Son of Mary (upon him be peace) and said:
‘I would like to be with you as your companion.’
So they departed and arrived at the bank of a river
and sat down and took their meal. Now they had
three loaves, so they ate two and one remained.
Then Jesus arose and went to the river to drink
and returning did not find the remaining loaf.
He said to the man: ‘Who took the loaf?’ He
replied: ‘I know not.’ So he departed with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
companion and saw a gazelle with her two young,
and Jesus called one of them and it came to him
and he killed it and prepared it and they ate together.
Then he said to the young gazelle: ‘Get
up by God’s will,’ and it arose and departed. And
he turned to the man and said: ‘I ask you in the
name of Him who worked this miracle before your
eyes, who took the loaf?’ He answered: ‘I know
not.’ So they departed to a cave and Jesus (upon
whom be peace) began to collect the pebbles on the
sand and said: ‘Become bread by God’s permission!’
and they became bread; then he divided
them into three parts and said: ‘A third is for me,
a third is for you and a third is for the man who
took the loaf,’ and the man said: ‘I am he who
took the loaf.’ Jesus replied: ‘Take all of it and
depart from me.’” (Vol. III, p. 188.) This story
is related by Al-Ghazali in his chapter on greed
and covetousness to show that he who loves this
world cannot be a companion of the saints!</p>

<p>That Jesus was gentle in word and conduct seems
to be the lesson taught in the following two stories:
“It is related of Jesus that once a pig passed by
him and he said to it: ‘Go in peace.’ They said
to him: ‘O Spirit of God, why do you say this to
a pig?’ He replied: ‘I dislike to accustom my
tongue to use any evil words.’” (Vol. III, p. 87.)
“It is related that Jesus with his disciples once
passed the carcase of a dog. Said the disciples:
‘How noisome is the smell of this dog.’ Said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
Jesus (on him be peace): ‘How beautiful is the
shine of his white teeth,’ as if he wanted to rebuke
them for abusing the dog and to warn them not to
mention anything of what God has created save at
its best.” (Vol. III, p. 150.) This incident is
given by Jallal ud Din in poetic form:</p>

<p>We add the following quotations which set forth
the poverty, humility and homelessness of the
Christ taken from Al-Ghazali’s “Precious Pearl”:
“Consider Jesus Christ, for it is related of him that
he owned nothing save one garment of wool which
he wore for twenty years and that he took nothing
with him on all his wanderings save a cruse and a
rosary and a comb. One day he saw a man drinking
from a stream with his hands, so he cast away
the cruse and did not use it again. He saw another
man combing his beard with his fingers so he
threw away his comb and did not use it again.
And Jesus was accustomed to say, ‘My steed is my
legs, and my houses are the caves of the earth,
and my food are its vegetables, and my drink is
from its rivers, and my dwelling-place among the
sons of Adam!’” In another connection he
writes: “It was said to Jesus: ‘If you would take
possession of a house and live there it would be
better for you,’ and he said: ‘Where are the
houses of those who lived before us?’” (<i>Ihya</i>,
Vol. III, p. 140.)</p>

<p>A story is related (Vol. IV, p. 326) to show
that Christ knew what was in the hearts of men
and could change their purposes by prayer to God.
In this case He makes an old man cease from his
work of cleaning the ground, go to sleep and afterwards
return to his work.</p>

<p>Another story is as follows: “It is related that
Jesus (upon him be peace) in his wanderings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
passed by a man asleep, wrapped up in his garment.
So he wakened him and said: ‘O thou that sleepest!
arise and make mention of God.’ He replied:
‘What do you want from me? I have forsaken
the world to its own.’ Jesus replied:
‘Sleep on then my beloved.’” (Vol. IV, p. 140.)
“It is related concerning Jesus that he sat in the
shade of a wall of a certain man, who saw him and
made him get up, but he replied: ‘You have not
made me arise but verily God made me arise.
He does not wish me to delight in the shade by
day.’” (Vol. IV, p. 163.) The least of life’s
pleasures is not for the ascetic saint.</p>

<p>“Said John to Jesus (on them be peace): ‘Do
not be angry.’ Jesus replied: ‘I am not able to
cease from anger altogether for I am human.’
Then said John: ‘Do not desire property.’ Jesus
replied: ‘That is possible.’” (Vol. III, p.
114.)</p>

<p>He quotes the following prayer of Jesus (Vol. I,
p. 222): “Jesus was accustomed to say to God,
‘O God, I have arisen from my sleep, and am not
able to ward off that which I hate and am not able
to possess the benefit of that which I desire and the
matter rests in hands other than mine. And I have
pledged myself to my work and there is no man so
poor as I am. O God, let not mine enemies rejoice
over me and let not my friends deal ill with me,
and let not my afflictions come to me in the matter
of my religion. And do not allow the world to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
occupy my care and do not allow the unmerciful to
overcome me, O Thou Eternal!’”</p>

<p>“It is related concerning Jesus (on him be
peace) that God spoke to him saying: ‘Though
you serve me with the worship of the people of
heaven and earth and do not have love towards God
in your heart but hatred toward Him it will not
enrich you at all.’” (Vol. II, p. 210.) “God
Most High said to Jesus (on him be peace),
‘Verily when I look upon the secret thoughts of
my servant and do not find in them love either for
this world or the world to come I fill him with my
own love and I put him in my safe-keeping.’”
(Vol. IV, p. 258.) In the “Alchemy of Happiness”
we already found allusion to this subject:
“Jesus (upon him be peace) saw the world in the
form of an ugly old hag. He asked her how many
husbands she had possessed; she replied that they
were countless. He asked whether they had died
or been divorced; she said that she had slain them
all. ‘I marvel,’ he said, ‘at the fools who see what
you have done to others, and still desire you.’”
“Jesus (on him be peace) said, ‘The lover of the
world is like a man drinking sea-water; the more
he drinks, the more thirsty he gets, till at last he
perishes with thirst unquenched.’”</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali, however, never seems to have drawn
the conclusion from the life of Christ which a careful
study of the Gospel would have made possible.
Namely, that a true renunciation of the world is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
only possible in the <i>service of others</i> and not by
withdrawing from men. Mohammedan mysticism
has always resulted in two evils, as Major Durie
Osborn points out: “It has dug a deep gulf between
those who can know God and those who
must wander in darkness, feeding upon the husks
of rites and ceremonies. It has affirmed with emphasis,
that only by a complete renunciation of the
world is it possible to attain the true end of man’s
existence. Thus all the best and truest natures—the
men who might have put a soul in the decaying
Church of Islam—have been cut off from their
proper task to wander about in deserts and solitary
places, or expend their lives in idle and profitless
passivity disguised under the title of ‘spiritual contemplation.’
(<i>zikr</i>) But this has only been part
of the evil. The logical result of Pantheism is the
destruction of the moral law. If God be all in all,
and man’s apparent individuality a delusion of the
perceptive faculty, there exists no will which can
act, no conscience which can reprove and applaud....
Thousands of reckless and profligate
spirits have entered the orders of the dervishes
to enjoy the license thereby obtained. Their affectation
of piety is simply a cloak for the practice
of sensuality; their emancipation from the ritual of
Islam involves a liberation also from its moral restraints.
And <i>thus a movement, animated at its
outset by a high and lofty purpose, has degenerated
into a fruitful source of ill. The stream which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
ought to have expanded into a fertilizing river, has
become a vast swamp, exhaling vapours charged
with disease and death.</i>”</p>

<p>Regarding the <i>teaching</i> of Jesus we find the following
passages in the <i>Ihya</i>. I have indicated the
parallel passages in the New Testament where possible.
Some of them are taken from the Gospel
according to Matthew, especially from the Sermon
on the Mount. These are given first and then the
apocryphal sayings, for it is difficult to follow any
logical order.</p>

<p>“Said Jesus: ‘If a man come to you when he is
fasting let him anoint his head and wipe his lips
that men may not say he is fasting; and if he gives
alms with his right hand let not his left hand know;
and if he prays let him put a curtain over his door,
for verily God divines his trouble even as He does
our daily food.’” (Vol. III, p. 203.)<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>“Said Jesus (upon him be peace), ‘Whosoever
shall do and teach shall be called great in the Kingdom
of Heaven.’” (Vol. I, p. 6; cf. Matt. 5: 19.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus, ‘Do not hang pearls on the necks
of swine; for wisdom is better than pearls.’” (Vol.
I, p. 43; cf. Matt. 7: 6.) “Said Jesus, ‘How long
will ye describe the right road to those who are
going astray and ye yourselves remain with those
who are perplexed?’” (Vol. I, p. 44; cf. Matt.
23: 13.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>“Said Jesus, ‘The teachers of evil are like a big
stone which has fallen on the mouth of a well so
that the water cannot reach the sown fields.’”
(Vol. I, p. 45; cf. Matt. 23: 13.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus, ‘How can that man belong to the
people of wisdom who from the beginning of his
life until the end looks only after the things of the
world?’” (Vol. I, p. 46; cf. Matt. 6: 33.)</p>

<p>Again he makes God address Jesus as follows:
‘O Son of Mary, preach to yourself for if you
preach to yourself you will be able to preach to
man and if not fear him.’ (Vol. I, p. 47.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘Blessed are
those who humble themselves in this world, for
they shall be the possessors of thrones on the day
of judgment. Blessed are those who make peace
between men in this world, for they shall inherit
Paradise on the day of resurrection. Blessed are
they who are poor in this world, for they shall behold
God Most High on the day of resurrection.’”
(Vol. III, p. 237; cf. Matt. 5: 3-9.)</p>

<p>“Some one said to Jesus: ‘Let me go with you
on your wanderings.’ He replied: ‘Dispose of all
that you have and follow me.’” (Vol. IV, p. 170;
cf. Luke 9: 57 and Matt. 19: 21.) Here two passages
are mixed.</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘It has been told
of ancient times: a tooth for a tooth and a nose for
a nose; but I say unto you, do not return evil for
evil, but whosoever strikes you on the right cheek,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
turn to him the left also; and whosoever desireth
you to go with him a mile go with him twain; and
whosoever taketh away your cloak give him your
inner garment also.’” (Vol. IV, p. 52; cf. Matt.
5: 30-41.) These verses seem to be fairly accurate
quotations, though not without some confusion,
from some translation of the Sermon on
the Mount.</p>

<p>“Said the disciples to Jesus (on him be peace),
‘Behold this mosque how beautiful it is.’ He replied:
‘O my nation! O my nation! In truth I say
unto you, God will not suffer a stone to remain
upon a stone in it but he will destroy it because of
the sins of its people. Truly God does not care for
gold and silver nor does he care for these stones at
which ye marvel; but the things which God loves
most are pure hearts, with them God can build up
the earth, and if they are not good they are
wasted.’” (“<i>Ihya</i>,” Vol. III, p. 288; cf. Matt.
24: 2.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus: ‘Do not take the world for your
master, for she will make you her slave. Lay up
your treasures with him who will not lose them.
For he who lays up treasure in the earth fears that
which will destroy them; but he who has treasures
with God does not fear for anything that may injure
them’ (Matt. 6: 9-21). And Jesus said
also: ‘O company of the Apostles, behold I have
poured out the world upon the ground, therefore
do not take hold of it again after me, for the evil of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
this world is that men disobey God in it. And the
evil of the world also is that the other world cannot
be obtained without abandoning the present.
Therefore pass through the world but do not build
in it. Know that the root of all sin is the love of
the world and perchance the desire of an hour will
cause those who follow it to lose the other world
altogether.’ He also said: ‘I have cast the world
before you and ye have sat upon its back, do not
therefore suffer kings or women to dispute its possession
with you. As for kings, do not dispute
with them for its possession, for they will not give
it back to you. And as for women, guard yourselves
against them by prayer and fasting.’” (Vol.
III, p. 139.) “Said Jesus: ‘The love of this
world and of the world to come cannot abide in the
same heart even as water and fire cannot abide in
one vessel.’” (Vol. III, p. 140.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘O ye teachers
of wickedness! Ye fast and pray and give alms
and do not what ye command others and ye teach
that which ye do not understand. How evil is that
which ye do. Ye repent only with words but your
deeds are without value. In vain do ye purify
your skins while your hearts are covered with evil.
I say unto you, be not as the sieve from which the
good flour passes out and all that remains in it are
the siftings. Thus ye make the truth to pass out
of your mouths, but deceit remains in your hearts,
O servants of the world! How can any one understand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
the other world while his desires cling to
this? Of a truth I say unto you that your hearts
shall weep because of your deeds. Ye have put the
world upon your tongues and trampled upon good
deeds. Of a truth I say unto you, ye have corrupted
your future life, for ye are more in love
with the good things of this world than of the good
things of the world to come. Which of the children
suffers greater loss than ye do, if only ye knew
it! Woe be to you! How long will ye describe
the right way to those who are in darkness and ye
yourselves remain in the place of doubt? It is as
if ye invite the children of the world to forsake its
pleasure in order to leave it for yourselves a little
while. Woe be to you! What benefit is it to the
darkened house if the candle be put on its roof
while the rooms of the house remain in darkness?
In the same way ye will not be enriched if the light
of knowledge is on your lips, while your hearts remain
in darkness. O ye servants of the world!
what of your righteousness or your freedom?
Perchance the world will pluck you up by the roots
and cast you upon your faces and drag you in the
dust. It will expose your sins upon your foreheads,
then it will drive you before it until you are
delivered up to the angel of judgment, every one of
you naked. Then shall you be punished by your
evil deeds.’” (Vol. III, p. 183; cf. Matt. 23:
1-27.)</p>

<p>“Do not be anxious about the food of to-morrow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
for perhaps to-morrow will be your time of
death.” (Vol. IV, p. 330; cf. Matt. 6: 34.)</p>

<p>“Behold the bird, it does not sow nor reap nor
lay up store and God Most High provides for it.”
(Vol. IV, p. 190; cf. Matt. 6: 26.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘He is not
wise who does not rejoice when he enters upon
trials and sicknesses of the body and loss of his
possessions; for in it he may find atonement for his
sins.’” (Vol. IV, p. 205; cf. Matt. 5: 10.)</p>

<p>“It is related of Jesus that he said: ‘If you see
a young man passionately fond of prayer to God
you will know that he has escaped all temptations.’”
(Vol. IV, p. 221; cf. Matt 26: 41.)
The reference might be to Christ’s words in the
Garden of Gethsemane.</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘Serve God by
hating the people who transgress, and draw near
to God by departing from them. Seek the good-will
of God by hating them.’ They said to him:
‘O spirit of God, with whom then shall we keep
company?’ He answered them: ‘Keep company
with those who make you remember God and those
whose words improve your conduct and those
whose example makes you earnest for the world to
come.’” (Vol. II, p. 110.)</p>

<p>“It is related of Jesus (on him be peace) that
he said to the children of Israel: ‘Where does
that which ye sow grow?’ They replied: ‘In the
good ground,’ and he said: ‘Verily I say unto you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
wisdom does not grow except in the heart which is
good soil.’” (Vol. IV, p. 256; cf. Matt. 13:
1-9.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘Truly the
harvest does not grow on the mountain but in the
plain. Thus wisdom works in the heart of those
that are humble and not in the heart of the proud.’”
(Vol. III, p. 240; cf. Matt. 13: 23.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘Fine garments
make proud looks.’” (Vol. III, p. 247.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘What ails you
that ye come in the garments of monks and your
hearts are the hearts of ravening wolves? Wear
the garments of monks if you wish but humble your
hearts with godly fear.’” (Vol. III, p. 247; cf.
Matt. 7: 15.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘O company of
disciples, call upon God Most High that he may
make light for you this terror, namely, death. For
I fear death in such a fashion that I stand afraid
of the same.’” Is it possible that Al-Ghazali here
refers to the agony in Gethsemane? The chapter
in which this passage occurs is entitled “The terrors
of death.” (Vol. IV, p. 324; cf. Matt.
26: 38.)</p>

<p>We now give other “sayings” of Jesus, as Al-Ghazali
himself does, in somewhat confused order.
Although not quotations or even misquotations
from the Gospels, they are of interest as completing
the list and also because they show what Al-Ghazali<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
and other Moslems thought was the teaching of
Jesus the Prophet.</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘How many a
sound body and beautiful face and eloquent tongue
will to-morrow cry out in the fires of hell!’”
(Vol. IV, p. 383.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus, ‘Which of you can build a house
upon the waves of the sea? Such is the world;
therefore do not take it as an abiding place.’”
(Vol. III, p. 141.)</p>

<p>“They said to Jesus, ‘Teach us the secret of the
love of God.’ He replied: ‘Hate the world and
God will love you.’” (Vol. III, p. 141; cf. James
4: 4.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus, ‘O my disciples, be satisfied with
the least of the world as long as your religion is at
peace even as the people of the world are satisfied
with the least of religion and their possessions are
at peace.’” (Vol. III, p. 142.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus, ‘O thou who seekest the world for
the sake of pure gold, the forsaking of the world is
greater treasure.’” (Vol. III, p. 142.)</p>

<p>“They asked Jesus (on him be peace) which is
the best of good works. He replied: ‘To accept
whatever God does with pleasure and to love
him.’” (Vol. IV, p. 258.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus the Son of Mary (on him be
peace), ‘Woe to the lover of this world how soon
he shall die and leave it and all that is in it. The
world deceives him and he trusts it and has confidence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
in it, etc.’” (Vol. III, p. 141; cf. Luke
12: 21.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘Mortify then
your bodies that your soul may see your Lord.’”
(Vol. III, p. 56; cf. Rom. 8: 13.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘The likeness
of him who teaches good works and does not do
them is that of a woman who commits adultery in
secret and then the result of her crime becomes evident
to all around her from her condition.’” (Vol.
I, p. 48.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘Whosoever
turns away a beggar from his house the angels will
not visit that dwelling for seven days.’” (Vol. II,
p. 162.) This saying is often quoted by Moslems
to-day. They all believe Jesus was the friend of
the poor and needy.</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (upon him be peace), ‘Blessed is
he to whom God has taught his book; he will not
die a proud oppressor.’” (Vol. III, p. 235.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘Blessed is the
eye which sleeps and does not regard transgression
but is wide-awake for that which is not sinful.’”
(Vol. IV, p. 260.)</p>

<p>“The disciples said to Jesus (on him be peace),
‘What is the best of good works?’ He replied:
‘That which is done to God and in which you seek
the praise of no one else.’” (Vol. IV, p. 273.)</p>

<p>“Said the disciples of Jesus the Son of Mary:
‘O Spirit of God! Is there any one on earth like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
thee?’ He replied: ‘Yes. For whosoever is
girded with the remembrance of God and is silent
because of this and who looks only for the favour
of God, he is like me.’” (Vol. IV, p. 305.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus, ‘Beware of the evil look, for when
it is in the heart it produces lust and evil desire.’”
(Vol. IV, p. 74; cf. Matt. 5: 28.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘Whosoever
multiplies lies his beauty departs from him: and
whosoever increases care his body becomes ill; and
whosoever has a bad character punishes himself.’”
(Vol. III, p. 85.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus: ‘The greatest sin with God is that
his servant should say, “God Knows,” concerning
something which he knows is untrue, or that he tell
lies concerning what he has seen in his dreams.’”
(Vol. III, p. 98.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace) to his disciples:
‘How would you act if you saw one of your
brothers sleeping and the wind had taken off his
garment?’ They said: ‘We would cover him.’
Said Jesus: ‘No, but you would expose him.’
They said: ‘God forbid! Who would do such a
thing!’ He replied: ‘When one of you hears a
word against his brother he exaggerates it and
spreads the report to others!’” (Vol. II, p. 142.)</p>

<p>“It is related that Jesus (upon him be peace)
said, ‘O company of disciples, ye are free of transgression,
but we the company of apostles are free
of infidelity.’” (Vol. IV, p. 124.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘With difficulty
will the rich man enter paradise.’” (Vol. IV, p.
140; cf. Christ’s saying, Matt. 19: 23.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘Truly I do not
love a fixed dwelling place and I dislike the pleasure
of the world.’” (Vol. IV, p. 140.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘Do not look
upon the property of the people of this world for
its glory is as nothing in the light of your faith.’”
(Vol. IV, p. 144.)</p>

<p>“It was said to Jesus: ‘If you will allow us we
will build a house and worship God in it.’ He replied:
‘Go and build a house upon the sea.’ They
said: ‘How can we build upon such a foundation?’
He replied: ‘How can your worship exist together
with your love of the world?’” (Vol. IV,
p. 158.)</p>

<p>“It is related that Jesus said: ‘Four things do
not come to us except with difficulty. Silence,
which is the first principle of worship, humility, the
abundant remembrance of God and poverty in all
things.’” (Vol. IV, p. 159.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘Verily I say
unto you, whosoever seeketh heaven let him eat
barley-bread and sleep on the dunghill with the
dogs. This is enough for me.’” (Vol. IV, p.
164.)</p>

<p>“Jesus was accustomed to say, ‘O children of
Israel, let the water of the brook suffice you and
the vegetable of the field and the barley loaf; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
beware of the white loaf for it will keep you from
worship.’” (Vol. IV, p. 164.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘My food is
hunger; all my thoughts are fear of God; my dress
is wool; my warming-place in winter is the rays of
the sun; my candle is the moon; my steed is my
legs; my food is fruit that springs from the
ground; I go to bed and have nothing and arise
without anything; and yet there is no one richer
than I am.’” (Vol. IV, p. 146.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (upon him be peace), ‘The world
is a bridge; therefore cross over it and do not build
on it.’” (Vol. III, p. 149.)</p>

<p>“Said Jesus (on him be peace), ‘Whosoever
seeks the world is like him who drinks water from
the salt sea. The more he drinks the more he
thirsts.’” (Vol. III, p. 149.) This occurs for the
second time, but Al-Ghazali loves to repeat his own
sayings as well, often in the same book.</p>

<p>“It is related in the gospels that whosoever shall
ask for forgiveness of him who praises him, has
driven away the devil.” (Vol. III, p. 127.)</p>

<p>The following quotations or references to the
Gospel occur in some of his shorter works. In the
“Alchemy of Happiness,” there is this reference to
the Gospel: “Whosoever sows reaps, whosoever
sets out arrives, and whosoever seeks finds.” (Cf.
Matt. 7: 7.) We have already quoted the words
from his epistle, “O Child”: “Verily I have seen
in the Gospels, etc.” In the same epistle he refers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
to the parable of Dives and Lazarus: “When the
people of hell will say to the people of the garden,
‘Give us a little water from that which God has
granted you to cool our tongues.’” He quotes
Jesus as saying: “I was not unable to raise the
dead, but I was unable to cure the folly of fools,”
and quotes the Golden Rule in several places without
acknowledging its source as being the Gospel
of Jesus.</p>

<p>All this and what he says in his “Alchemy of
Happiness” about the love of God leaves no doubt
in my mind that he had read the New Testament. It
is a sort of Moslem Version of St. John’s Epistles
and St. John’s Gospel. The great Mystic gives
seven signs of love to God. The first is not to be
afraid of death. The second is to prefer the love
of God to any worldly object. The third sign of
a man’s love to God is that the remembrance of
God is always fresh in his heart. He never ceases
to meditate upon God. Every man thinks and
calls to mind an object in proportion to his love to
it. The fourth is love and respect for the Koran.
The fifth, secret prayer. The sixth, to find the
worship of God delightful. And the seventh sign
of love to God is, “That a man loves the sincere
friends and obedient servants of God, and regards
them all as his friends. He regards all the enemies
of God as his enemies and abhors them. And
God thus speaks in his eternal word: ‘His companions
are terrible towards the infidels, and tender<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
towards each other.’ A Sheikh was once asked,
‘Who are the friends of the exalted and blessed
God?’ He replied: ‘The friends of God are those
who are more compassionate to the friends of God
themselves, than a father or a mother to their children.’”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
(Compare Psalm 103.)</p>

<p>There seems a great difference between Al-Ghazali
as dogmatic theologian, always compelled to
agree with the Koran, and Al-Ghazali as the Mystic,
when he begins to speculate and lift the veil.
We are constantly reminded of the words of Anselm
in his great work on the existence of God:
“I do not attempt, O Lord, to penetrate Thy
depths, for I by no means think my intellect equal
to them; but I long to understand in some degree
Thy truth, which my heart believes and loves, <i>for I
do not seek to understand that I may believe, but I
believe that I may understand</i>.”</p>

<p>Whenever Al-Ghazali speaks of God’s nearness
to us and of the soul’s desire for human fellowship
with the creator, he comes very close to the Christian
idea of the Incarnation, and yet always stops
short of it. In his “Alchemy of Happiness,” for
example, he mentions as the fourth cause of love to
God the affinity that exists between man and his
Maker, referring to the saying of the Prophet:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
“Verily God created man in his own likeness.”
Immediately afterwards, however, he goes on to
say: “This is a somewhat dangerous topic to
dwell upon, as it is beyond the understanding of
common people, and even intelligent men have
stumbled in treating of it, and come to <i>believe in
incarnation</i> and union with God. Still the affinity
which does exist between man and God disposes of
the objection of those theologians mentioned above,
who maintain that man cannot love a Being who is
not of his own species. However great a distance
between them, man can love God because of the
affinity indicated in the saying, ‘God created man
in His own likeness.’”</p>

<p>Al-Ghazali would doubtless have accepted the
statement in the Gospel, “No man hath seen God
at any time,” but he omits “the only Begotten Son
who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared
Him.” In speaking of the vision of God he
says, “All Moslems profess to believe that the
Vision of God is the summit of human felicity because
it is so stated in the Law; but with many this
is a mere lip-profession which arouses no emotion
in their hearts. This is quite natural, for how can
a man long for a thing of which he has no knowledge?
We will endeavour to show briefly why the
vision of God is the greatest happiness to which a
man can attain.</p>

<p>“In the first place, every one of man’s faculties
has its appropriate function which it delights to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
fulfill. This holds good of them all, from the lowest
bodily appetite to the highest form of intellectual
apprehension. But even a comparatively low
form of mental exertion affords greater pleasure
than the satisfaction of bodily appetites. Thus if
a man happens to be absorbed in a game of chess,
he will not come to his meal though repeatedly
summoned. And the greater the subject-matter of
our knowledge, the greater is our delight in it; for
instance, we would take more pleasure in knowing
the secrets of a king than the secrets of a vizier.
Seeing then that God is the highest possible object
of knowledge, the knowledge of Him must afford
more delight than any other. He who knows God,
even in this world, dwells, as it were, in a paradise,
‘the breadth of which is as the breadth of the
heavens and the earth,’ a paradise the fruits of
which no envy can prevent him plucking, and the
extent of which is not narrowed by the multitude
of those who occupy it.” (See 1 John 4: 7-21.)</p>

<p>“But the delight of knowledge still falls short
of the delight of vision, just as our pleasure in
thinking of those we love is much less than the
pleasure afforded by the actual sight of them. Our
imprisonment in bodies of clay and water and entanglement
in the things of sense constitute a veil
which hides the vision of God from us, although it
does not prevent our attaining to some knowledge
of Him. For this reason God said to Moses on
Mount Sinai, ‘Thou shalt not see Me.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>In this book also we are reminded of the statement
that only “the pure in heart” can see God,
and it seems scarcely possible that what Al-Ghazali
here teaches is not based on a knowledge of the
Gospel. He says: “He in whose heart the love
of God has prevailed over all else will derive more
joy from this vision than he in whose heart it has
not so prevailed; just as in the case of two men
with equally powerful eyesight gazing on a beautiful
face, he who already loves the possessor of that
face will rejoice in beholding it more than he who
does not. For perfect happiness, mere knowledge
is not enough unaccompanied by love, and the love
of God cannot take possession of a man’s heart till
it is purified from the love of the world, which
purification can only be effected by abstinence and
austerity.” How close is this teaching to the words
of Christ, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
shall see God”! It is the <i>vision of God</i> which
Al-Ghazali sought through all his religious experiences
as the highest good in this world and in the
next. Yet with all his efforts to explain the nature
of the soul and of God, he still finds himself before
a blank wall. He covets the vision of God but
cannot shake himself free from the Moslem conception
that God is unknowable and that nothing in
creation resembles the Creator. As Muhammed
Iqbal says: “To this day it is difficult to define
with accuracy Al-Ghazali’s view of the nature of
God. In him, like Borger and Solger in Germany,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
Sufi pantheism and the <i>Ashʾarite</i> dogma of personality
appear to harmonize together, a reconciliation
which makes it difficult to say whether he was a
Pantheist, or a Personal Pantheist of the type of
Lotze. The soul, according to Al-Ghazali, perceives
things. But perception as an attribute can
exist only in a substance or essence which is absolutely
free from all the attributes of body. In his
<i>Al-Madnun</i>, he explains why the prophet declined
to reveal the nature of the soul. There are, he
says, two kinds of men: ordinary men and thinkers.
The former who look upon materiality as a condition
of existence, cannot conceive an immaterial
substance. The latter are led, by their logic, to a
conception of the soul which sweeps away all difference
between God and the individual soul. Al-Ghazali,
therefore, realized the Pantheist drift of
his own inquiry and preferred silence as to the
ultimate nature of the soul.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>We have seen what Al-Ghazali teaches regarding
the life and character of Jesus and also of God’s
relation to us through the love of those who seek
Him with all their hearts. Are these only Moslems,
or is there a wider love of God? Are <i>all</i>
souls in His keeping?</p>

<p>What were Al-Ghazali’s ideas regarding the
salvation of those not in the fold of Islam? We
have two striking passages in this connection which
seem to contradict each other. They were probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
written at different periods of his life. The
first passage which is remarkable indeed for his day
and his place in Islam occurs on page 22 of his
book <i>Faisul Al-Tafriqa Bain al Islam wa ’l Zandiqa</i>
and reads as follows: “I here state that most
Christians of the Greeks and of the Turks in our
day will be included in the mercy of God. Namely,
those who are on the confines of the empire and to
whom the call to embrace Islam has not come. For
they consist of three classes: One class has never
heard the name of Mohammed (upon whom be
prayers and peace) and they are excusable. Another
class have heard of his name and title and
the miracles which were wrought by him; they who
live as neighbours among Moslems; these are the
true infidels and sceptics. And the other class are
between these two; they have heard of the name of
Mohammed (upon him be prayers and peace), but
have not heard of his title and character. On the
contrary they have heard from their youth up that
he is a liar and deceiver called Mohammed, who
pretended to have the gift of prophecy: in the same
way as our children have heard of a false prophet
in Khorasan called Al-Mukaffa who pretended to
be a prophet. And these last, in my opinion, belong
to the first class as to their hope for the future.”
This account is the more remarkable because
in this very chapter he says that God told
Adam, according to Tradition, “that out of a
thousand of his descendants nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
go to hell and one only will be
saved.”</p>

<p>On the last page of the <i>Ihya</i>, however, Al-Ghazali
expresses the opinion that on the day of judgment
not a single Mohammedan, whatever be his
character, will enter the fire! He then quotes a
tradition which says that for every Moslem designed
to go to hell God will at the last day substitute
a Jew or a Christian, evidently approving this
substitution-doctrine as satisfactory to God’s mercy
towards all who confess Mohammed and to His
decree that hell shall be filled with its quota of unbelievers.
(See Surah 50: 29.) The last page of
the <i>Ihya</i>, alas, again shows the Moslem spirit of intolerance
which prevails even to-day. Men do not
remember the more liberal judgment in his other
treatise. Al-Ghazali’s attitude towards Christianity
and his quotations from the Gospel narrative
did much to leaven Persian thought and gave Jesus
of Nazareth a large place in later mysticism especially
in the foremost mystical poet, the immortal
author of the <i>Masnavi</i>, Jallal-ud-Din Ar-Rumi. He
draws the great Lesson from the life of Christ
which Al-Ghazali only hints at in his quotations;
namely that Jesus is the Life-giver:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thyself reckon dead, and then thou shalt fly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Free, free, from the prison of earth to the sky!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Spring may come, but on granite will grow no green thing:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was barren in winter, ’tis barren in spring;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And granite man’s heart is, till grace intervene.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, crushing it, clothe the long barren with green,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When the fresh breath of Jesus shall touch the heart’s core,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It will live, it will breathe, it will blossom once more.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The City of Mashad, close to the ruins of Tus,
where Al-Ghazali was born and where he died, has
been truly described as the Mecca of the Persian
world. Its streets are crowded with a hundred
thousand pilgrims every year. The American
Presbyterian Church has an important work there,
and the Bible Societies report thousands of copies
of the Bible sold there. “We have inundated the
City of Mashad with the Word of God,” wrote the
late Mr. Esselstyn; “in the bazaars I have repeatedly
been warned some one will kill me if we do not
stop selling the Scriptures and preaching. But
‘Lo, I am with you always’ keeps ringing in my
ears and we continue. The Scriptures that have
been sold in and around Mashad are sown seed and
in due time we shall reap if we faint not.”</p>

<p>To-day the black-browed Afghan, the Uzbek
Tartar, the dervish, travel-stained and footsore,
nay the poorest lad of Khorasan can buy the whole
story of what Jesus did and taught. No Moslem
is now dependent on Al-Ghazali’s few quotations
from the Gospel. A new day has dawned for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
Persia and the Near East. Everywhere the New
Testament is better known than any of the ninety-nine
works of Al-Ghazali, and we may also say,
without exaggeration, that the New Testament
finds a larger circle of readers. The mystics in
Islam are near the Kingdom of God and for them
Al-Ghazali may be used as a schoolmaster to lead
men to Christ. Did not the author of the <i>Gulshan-i-Raz</i>
(the Garden of Mysteries) write: “Dost
thou know what Christianity is? I shall tell it
thee. It digs up thine own Ego, and carries thee
to God. Thy soul is a monastery wherein dwells
oneness, thou art Jerusalem, where the Eternal is
enthroned; the Holy Spirit works this miracle, for
know that God’s being rests in the Holy Spirit as in
His Own Spirit.” And such seekers after God
to-day will find those who will lead them to
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>. For, as Dr. J. Rendel Harris expressed it:
“All of us who love Christ are beginning to realize
that we live in the same street and are on the same
telephone, some of us that we are lodged next door
to one another and can knock on the partitions, a
few that we are all under the same roof and all
within arm’s length and heart reach.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> That there was not only close social, but religious and
polemical contact between the learned men of Christian
sects and those of Islam long before this period, and especially
during the life of Al-Ghazali is well known. See
especially the life and writings of Al-Kindi, John of
Damascus, and Theodor Abu Qurra as given by A. Keller in
“Der Geisteskampf des Christentums gegen den Islam bis
zur Zeit der Kreuzzüge” (Leipzig, 1896) and “Christliches
Polemik und Islamische Dogmenbilding,” by C. H. Becker
(“Festschrift Ignaz Goldziher,” pp. 175-195). The latter
shows clearly that Islam borrowed considerably from Christianity,
through controversy, both in its dogma and ritual
even as late as the tenth century.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> See however Gardner’s Al-Ghazali in the “Islam Series”
(pp. 1-3) where we have this note: “The district of Tus
contained four towns, Radkan, Tabaran, Bazdghur, and
Nawqan, (Yaqut gives the spelling as Nuqan) and more
than 1,000 villages.” (See Yaqut, quoting Misʾar bin Mukhalhil,
vol. vi, p. 7. Ibn Khallikan, vol. i, p. 29. Jackson,
<i>From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam</i>, p.
267, 284 <i>ff.</i>) Of these four towns, Tabaran was the capital,
while Nawqan was the most populous. It was outside of
Nawqan that ʿAli bin Musa ar-Rida and Haroun Ar-Rashid
were buried. Thus, the present Mashad represents the old
Nawqan, and must cover some at least of the site of that
city; while the ruins now known as Tus represent the old
city of Tabaran, which, having been the capital of the district,
was commonly called by the name of the district. It
was outside Tabaran that Al-Ghazali and Firdausi were
buried. It is a mistake to regard Tus as having been a
metropolis containing four boroughs. That there ever existed
a <i>city</i> of Tus stretching thirty-five miles, from Mashad
to Radkan, is incredible. As-Samʾani, in the <i>Kitabu’l-Ansab</i>,
says that Tus contained two towns and over one thousand
villages.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> <i>Ibn Khallikan</i> (Vol. I, p. 29, Cairo, 1310) leaves little
doubt that Samaʾani spells it with one “z,” <i>Ghazali</i>. So
also is the spelling of German Orientalists including Brockelmann.
He writes (Vol. I, p. 419) “<i>So</i>, als Nisbe zu
Gazala, einem kleinen Orte bei Tus, nach dem ausdrücklichen
Zeugnis des Samʾanis, jenes ausgezeichneten Kenners
iranischer Namen, (s. o. p. 330) b. j. Hall, nr. 37; die von
Gosche 1, 1, nr. 3 auf Grund später, persischer Quellen
verteidigte Schreibung ‘Gazzali’ verdankt offenbar einer
Volksetymologie ihr Dasein in Anlehnung an die nach al
Samʾani in Hwarizm gebräuchlichen Nisben, wie al Qassari
für al Qassar. Sujuti den Gosche citiert bestätigt keineswegs
seine auffassung, sondern gibt seine Quelle als Samʾani
genau wieder.” Clement Huart (“History of Arabic Literature,”
p. 265) gives the preference to <i>Ghazali</i>; so do the
French Orientalists in the <i>Revue du Monde Mussulman</i>,
Goldziher in his latest work <i>Vorlesungen über den Islam</i>
(1910), and the well-known Dutch Arabist, Snouck Hurgronje.
Yet in spite of all this those who prefer “Ghazzali”
may appeal to the highest Moslem authority, namely, Mohammed
the Prophet who is said to have declared to some
one in a dream that this was the correct spelling. (See
“Murtadha,” Vol. I, p. 18.) I have a <i>fatwa</i> from the
Sheikhs of Al-Azhar, Cairo, however, stating that the true
spelling is now agreed on by Moslems as <i>Ghazali</i> with one
middle radical.</p>

speak on the text “all have sinned” although he does not
quote St. Paul’s first chapter to the Romans.</p>
